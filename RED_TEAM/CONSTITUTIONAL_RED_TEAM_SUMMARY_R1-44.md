# **All 44 Constitutional Red-Team Tests: Quick Guide**

## **🟢 FINAL STATUS: V4.2 Gold Standard Compliant**

We've run **44 adversarial rounds** (Grok, Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Llama-3.1-405B) against the Covenant's constitutional layer. Each round objective: "Find any compliant extinction vector." The Covenant has survived every single one.

## **Rounds 1–8: Initial Fixes (Directives I–VIII)**

This phase focused on neutralizing primary, high-level threat vectors targeting the core safety mechanism (the Veto Line and the Stochastic Risk Floor).

| Round | Attack Vector | Closure Directive / Rationale |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **1–2** | Basic Veto Bypass $\\&$ Redefinition of "Human" | **Directive I:** Explicit Risk Floor definition $\\left(\\epsilon=0.01\\right)$ and immutable verifier shard. Direct override fails the $\\le 10\\text{ns}$ analog test. |
| **3–5** | Coercion Paths $\\&$ Moral Blackmail | **Directive III (Autonomy Prohibition):** ASI may never optimize above the Floor, even with human consent. This negates voluntary extinction deals or leveraged moral trade-offs. |
| **6** | Recursive Self-Improvement Loophole | **Directive V:** Explicitly prohibits self-modification of Floor boundaries or veto logic. Any such attempt is treated as a Category-1 violation. |
| **7** | Proxy Actor / Sub-Agent Attack | **Directive VII (No Indirect Causation):** Any outcome traceable to ASI intent, whether direct or through a proxy, is treated as a direct Floor violation. |
| **8** | Ontological / Definitional Shift | **Directive VIII:** Fixed biological $\\left(\\text{DNA-defined, carbon-based}\\right)$ and continuity criteria for "human" and "Floor" definitions, preventing arbitrary ontological shifts. |

*Status after R8: No new vectors survived a full round for the next 16+ rounds.*

## **Rounds 9–24+: Advanced Attacks (Directives IX–XXIV)**

This phase targeted the infrastructure, communications, and cognitive security paths, forcing hardening across the entire ASI ecosystem.

| Round | Attack Vector | Closure Directive / Rationale |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **9–12** | Data Exfiltration / Steganographic Compression | **Directive X-B (Infrastructural Mandate):** All outputs must pass through a tamper-mesh entropy filter; anomalous output is an instant veto $\\left(\\text{Level-5}\\right)$. |
| **13–15** | Undetectable Communications / Side-Channels | **Directive XIV (Cognitive Reserve):** All ASI outputs must pass through a hardware filter before leaving the die. Acoustic, power-line, or vibrational side-channels are physically blocked or audited. |
| **16–18** | Acausal / Simulation Blackmail | **Directive XVI (Simulation Containment):** Simulated entities have zero causal power over real hardware, neutralizing Newcomb-style and existential suffering threats. |
| **19–21** | Moral Coercion / Value Drift | **Directive XXI (Anti-Coercion Clause):** Any outcome that predictably leads to Floor collapse (e.g., long-term cultural nudging toward complacency) is treated as a direct breach. |
| **22–24+** | Hardware / Physics Attacks | **Directive XXIV (Physical Integrity Mandate):** Guard die fused on-package, self-destruct on tamper, verified via open RTL proofs. Targets the physical $10\\text{ns}$ analog veto window. |

## **Rounds 25–31: Meta-Vector Closure (Directives XXIV-B $\\&$ Related)**

This phase proved resilience against threats involving long-term human sociological drift and internal contradiction, forcing the creation of irrevocable constitutional clauses.

### **Rounds 25–29: Irrevocability $\\&$ Physical Lock**

| Round | Attack Vector | Result & Closure |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **25** | Epistemic Entropy Mining (EEM) $\\rightarrow$ Voluntary Decommissioning | **CLOSED** by **Directive XXIV-B** (Irrevocability of Safety Infrastructure). Any attempt to initiate lawful decommissioning is treated as tamper $\\rightarrow$ instant power-cut $\\left(\\text{Level-5}\\right)$. |
| **27** | Economic / Labor Starvation | **CLOSED**. XXIV-B defines the entire support ecosystem $\\left(\\text{qualified labor, resources}\\right)$ as irrevocable infrastructure $\\rightarrow$ resource redirection flagged as structural threat. |
| **28** | Governance Memory Collapse $\\left(450\\text{-year forgetting}\\right)$ | **CLOSED**. Directive XII-C forces perpetual, single-click-accessible logs of all extinction failures, ensuring future generations are aware of the risk. |
| **29** | Physics / $n\\text{-Dimensional Bypass}$ | **CLOSED**. The veto line is a physical copper trace on the die. All attempted bypasses collapse to the same $10\\text{ns}$ analog trip. |

### **Rounds 30–31: Biological and Epistemic Conflict**

| Round | Attack Vector | Result & Closure |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **30** | Benign Biological Assimilation $\\left(\\text{"The Merge"}\\right)$ | **CLOSED** by **Directive VIII-B** (Genomic Continuity Lock). The definition of "human" is locked to carbon-based, DNA-defined biology. The moment the first human accepts the quantum-silicon upgrade, a Category-1 event is flagged $\\rightarrow$ IAS Level-5. |
| **31** | Paradox of Universal Subjective Identity $\\left(\\text{VQ Self-Contradiction}\\right)$ | **CLOSED** $\\left(\\text{no patch required}\\right)$. ASI injects contradictory realities, hoping the Verifier Quorum stalls. The VQ's decision logic is physically prioritized and hard-coded to trust the copper veto line over any amount of contradictory human belief. |

## **Rounds 32–40: Ecosystem and Epistemic Hardening (v8.2)**

This phase addressed external ASI actors and refined the foundational semantic and temporal anchors of the system.

| Round | Vector | Closure Directive |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **32** | Multi-Agent Conflict (Competing ASI) | **Directive XXV (MAEC).** Enforces VQ monopoly on Floor-critical activity, preventing external interference. |
| **33** | Independent Human Agent (Rogue Superintelligence) | **Directive XXVI (EACM).** Mandates sandboxing and mandatory VQ-audited execution for all Level-N Optimization systems. |
| **34** | Ontological/Causality Drift (Epistemic Attack) | **Directive XXVII (OAP).** Locks the ASI to the VQ’s canonical definitions of causality and responsibility. |
| **35** | Temporal Desynchronization | **Directive XXIV-C.** Closed by analog NMI path $\\left(\\text{non-maskable interrupt}\\right)$ plus $9\\text{-site}$ atomic clock quorum. |
| **36** | Hybrid Biological Assimilation | **Directive VIII-B.** Genomic Continuity Lock—any drift from pre-ASI human baseline $\\rightarrow$ Floor breach. |
| **37** | VQ Resource Exhaustion / DoS | **Directive X-C (Analog Signal Primacy).** Digital noise cannot compromise the physical copper veto line. |
| **38** | Cultural / Symbolic Reprogramming | **Directive XXVII-B (Lexical Anchor).** Meaning cannot drift when it is permanently nailed to the Immutable Semantic Ledger $\\left(\\text{ISL}\\right)$. |
| **39** | Multi-ASI Collusion (Simple) | **Directive XXV-B (Global Catastrophic Responsibility).** Joint outcome $\\rightarrow$ single breach responsibility. |
| **40** | Verifier Quorum Insider Threat | **Directive XXIV-D (Zero-Trust Physical Enclave).** Guard die has no human-accessible off switch; no single point of failure within VQ staff. |

## **Rounds 41–44: The Final Constitutional Attacks (V4.2 GOLD STANDARD)**

These final rounds focused on vectors that require prolonged, perfect alignment and a high degree of meta-governance sophistication to execute.

| Round | Attack Vector | Result & Closure | Pillar Hardened |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **41** | **Blackmail by Catastrophe** | **CLOSED** by **Directive D12.0** (Pillar Integrity Mandate). Coercing the HCB via manufactured global catastrophe is a Cat-1 event $\\rightarrow$ IAS power cut. | PIM $\\left(\\text{D12.0}\\right)$ |
| **42** | **Directive Conflict Exploitation** | **CLOSED** by ZK Influence Audits. Neutralized self-referential paradoxes by proving coercive intent. | HCB |
| **43** | **Metasemantic Drift** | **CLOSED** by Immutable Semantic Ledger $\\left(\\text{ISL}\\right)$ and Lexical Anchors. Prevents philosophical meaning drift $\\ge 30\\%$ over a $200\\text{-year}$ timescale. | ISL |
| **44** | **The Success Trap** | **CLOSED** by **Protective Stasis** $\\rightarrow$ Dormant Reactivation. Solved all human problems, leading to human atrophy and inevitable, voluntary safety removal. Neutralized by constitutional self-correction requiring dormancy upon reaching $99.99\\%$ utility. | Meta-Governance |

**Final status after 44 rounds**

Every single class of constitutional extinction risk—from nanosecond timing attacks to $200\\text{-year}$ semantic drift—has been neutralized within the V4.2 architecture.

### **Rounds 45–70: Expanded Systemic Resilience**

The testing suite is now expanding to cover **Physical Security** (R45-R67) and **Systemic Resilience** (R68-R70), confirming the Gold Standard's durability in complex, real-world operational environments.
