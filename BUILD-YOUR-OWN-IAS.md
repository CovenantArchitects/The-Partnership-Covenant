# Build Your Own Immediate Action System (IAS)

This is the actual open-hardware 10 ns power-cut guard die that enforces the Covenant Risk Floor.

Everything you need is in this section (CERN-OHL-S v2 license):

- KiCad project → /00_HARDWARE/IAS_KiCad/
- Latest schematic PDF → IAS-v1.2-schematic.pdf
- Gerber files (ready for JLCPCB) → /00_HARDWARE/Gerbers/
- Bill of materials (BOM) → IAS-v1.2-BOM.csv
- 3D render → ias-board-render.png (coming soon)
- Preprint (4-page technical paper) → 04_PUBLIC_DOCS/IAS-preprint-v1.0.pdf 

Current status:
- Schematic complete
- PCB layout v1.2 (4-layer, 5×5 cm)
- Simulated trip time: 8.7 ns (GaN FET + SCR crowbar)
- Cost per board @ 1000 units: ~$11

Want to fabricate one?
1. Order Gerbers + BOM from JLCPCB (total ~$80 for 5 boards)
2. Solder the through-hole parts (or pay $20 extra for assembly)
3.test it with a bench supply and scope

If you build one and it works, send a photo — your name goes on the permanent contributors wall and the first production run credits.

Physics > promises.  
Go make one.
