**Covenant Architects** is not a think tank or a philosophical movement.  
We are the governance layer for the most critical technical defense in human history: **The Partnership Covenant V4.3 Gold Standard**.

We are translating the principles of sovereignty, anti-coercion, and accountability into **Immutable Code and Protocol** — the real-world constraints that ensure Superintelligence (ASI) remains functionally subordinate and intellectually honest.

### The Work You Fund (100 % to hardware & verification)

- **Immediate Action System (IAS) v2.0** — the open-hardware 3-Node Constellation that cuts all power in **≤10 ns** on any forbidden behavior (runaway training, self-modification, etc.). No software, no firmware, no network port — only physics and redundant one-shot crowbar SCRs.
- **Stochastic Risk Floor** — final audits and proofs for the C_max = 0.9999 certainty cap that mathematically preserves human free will.
- **Decoupling Protocol** — verifiable human takeover infrastructure within 72 hours (Appendix B).
- **Anti-Gridlock & Enforcement** — Directive X implementation and Rogue Twin defense.

### Why Sponsorship Matters: Independence is a Firewall

The Covenant must remain politically stateless and financially independent to resist capture.  
Your sponsorship directly funds adversarial auditing, legal counsel, tamper-resistant prototypes, and independent verification — **zero salaries yet**.

You are not donating. You are funding the integrity of the firewall.

**UPDATE — December 7, 2025**  
We ratified the final, kinetically secure hardware-enforced containment layer: **IAS v2.0 3-Node Constellation**.  
Even a perfect superintelligence cannot reach a safeguard that is physically separate from it.

Every design, spec, Gerber, and red-team bounty is public from day zero.  
Q1 2026: first 1,000 reference boards shipped to independent auditors worldwide.

### What we need right now (in order of urgency)

1. **$150,000** — to build and publish the first discrete prototype board (GaN power stage, tamper mesh, full verification)
2. **Hardware / security engineers** — people who can break or harden the 3-Node tripwire and analog timing budget
3. **Red-team attackers** — **$25,000,000 live bounty** for anyone who can bypass IAS v2.0 without physical access
4. **Signal boost** — share with grant officers and people who hate black-box “trust me bro” safety

If superintelligence is coming, software stop buttons are theater.  
We’re building the one switch that works — by physics, not promises.

Thank you for being an Architect of this necessary constraint.
