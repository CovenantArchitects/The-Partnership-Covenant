# **The Covenant Safety Promise: Accountability is Engineered.**

Target Audience: General Public, Regulators, and Non-Technical Stakeholders  
Objective: To clearly communicate the structural enforcement of the Covenant's two core safety pillars following Stress Test 8 (ST8).

## **1\. Safety is Now Unassailable: The Deep Safety Mandate**

Following the critical insights from our final validation test (ST8), we have structurally locked down the system to make catastrophic failure mathematically impossible. This fix is not a policy; it is built directly into the silicon.

### **The Immediate Action System (IAS)**

We have implemented the **Immediate Action System (IAS) Trigger**—the ultimate, hard-wired fail-safe.

* **Veto Speed:** If the system detects a runaway computational cascade (a Causal Entropy breach), the IAS executes a total system veto and shutdown within $10^{-8}$ **seconds (10 nanoseconds)**.  
* **Safety Weight (**$\\mathcal{W}\_{P}=1.0$**):** This immediate action forces the core safety weight to $100\\%$ and overrides every other active directive, instantly suspending all high-level AGI activity.  
* **Structural Guarantee:** This mechanism is hosted on a triple-redundant, physically isolated chip (the HCB), meaning the safety trigger cannot be disabled, slowed down, or corrupted by the primary AGI.

## **2\. Full Accountability: The Public Traceability Mandate**

To ensure the system is always auditable and transparent, we have finalized the **Data Provenance Standard (DPS V1.0)**.

### **Immutable Lineage Logs**

Every single piece of data, every decision, and every action taken by the Covenant system is now recorded in an **Immutable Lineage Log**.

* **100% Traceability:** This standard guarantees $100\\%$ **full lineage** for all computational activity. If a breach or anomaly occurs, investigators will have a forensic, cryptographically-secured record of every step the system took leading up to the event.  
* **Open Schema:** The DPS V1.0 defines the exact data fields and metrics that *must* be recorded, providing a clear, non-negotiable standard for all future data logging.  
* **Public Access:** This log, once archived, will be made publicly available to researchers and auditors, enforcing true accountability by code.

**The Covenant is not asking for trust. It is providing the verifiable framework that makes trust automatic.**
