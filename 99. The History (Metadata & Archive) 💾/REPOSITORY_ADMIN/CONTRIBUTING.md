# ✍️ Contributing to The Partnership Covenant

Thank you for your interest in helping build a constitutional operating system for superintelligence.

This document explains how to get involved, how decisions are made, and how contributions of all kinds are reviewed, tested, merged, and permanently archived.

The Partnership Covenant is a **high-assurance, open, auditable governance and technical architecture** designed to bound, direct, and constrain superintelligent systems through physics, cryptography, and structured human oversight.

### What We’re Building

The Partnership Covenant rests on **five non-negotiable primitives** that cannot be implemented with software safeguards alone:

1. **Immediate Action System (IAS) v2.0** — a physics-based, 3-Node Veto Constellation with a **≤10 ns** power-cut tripwire, eliminating the kinetic Single Point of Failure (SPOF).  
2. **Pillar Integrity Mandate (PIM)** — Directive 12.1: governance integrity itself is an extinction-level concern, enforced by CERTX telemetry.  
3. **Immutable Semantic Ledger (ISL)** — protocol against semantic drift, ensuring the *meaning* of the law is uncorruptible.  
4. **Stochastic Risk Floor** — enforced, irreducible uncertainty to preserve human agency.  
5. **Human Consensus Body (HCB) Hardening** — coercion-resistant, ZK-verifiable global sortition.

The project is now in the **deployment phase**: finalizing validated specs → securing funding for reference circuits → shipping open hardware → expanding meta-governance protocols.

### The Five Technical Pillars (Priority Areas)

1. **IAS v2.0 – Immediate Action System (Hardware)**  
   3-Node redundancy, tamper-evidence, physical one-way signaling.

2. **PIM – Pillar Integrity Mandate (The Watchdog)**  
   CERTX Telemetry integration, Entropy/Coherence thresholds, D12.1 override verification.

3. **ISL – Immutable Semantic Ledger**  
   Lexical Anchor hashing, semantic drift detection, testing against frontier models.

4. **Stochastic Risk Floor**  
   QRNG sourcing, proof-of-randomness trails, extinction immunity analysis.

5. **HCB Hardening**  
   Zero-knowledge sortition, anti-coercion design, Shamir’s Secret Sharing.

### Getting Started

1. Read the high-level overview → [README.md](https://github.com/CovenantArchitects/The-Partnership-Covenant/blob/main/covenant/00.%20The%20Mandate%20(Constitutional%20Authority)/00_OVERVIEW/README.md)  
2. Study the IAS v2.0 mandate → [IAS_v2.0_3_Node_Mandate.md](https://github.com/CovenantArchitects/The-Partnership-Covenant/blob/main/covenant/01.%20The%20Plan%20(Specifications%20%26%20Design)%20Tools/HARDWARE_DESIGN/IAS_KiCad/IAS_v2.0_3_Node_Mandate.md)  
3. Check recent decisions → [DECISION_HISTORY folder](https://github.com/CovenantArchitects/The-Partnership-Covenant/tree/main/covenant/99.%20The%20History%20(Metadata%20%26%20Archive)%20Archive/LOGS/DECISION_HISTORY)  
4. Fork → create branch → submit PR against `main`  
5. All PRs automatically run the governance integrity check [](https://github.com/CovenantArchitects/The-Partnership-Covenant/actions/workflows/governance-check-simple.yml)

**Red-team submissions must adhere to the CERTX Telemetry Rule.**

---

### How Contributions Are Reviewed

- **Triage** — within 48 h (label + routing)  
- **Review** — hardware, crypto, or governance experts (as needed)  
- **Red-team findings** — assessed for CERTX compliance first  
- **Merge** — ≥1 maintainer approval + all CI green + Decision Log entry (if Level 4)

All significant merges are permanently archived in the decision history.

### Governance & Decision Process

- Day-to-day: BDFL (Sean Sheppard) + maintainer team  
- Major changes: Public RFC → 7-day discussion → recorded vote → immutable log  
- Long-term: transition to full HCB sortition + ZK governance (already specified)

### Security & Responsible Disclosure

Found a governance bypass, spec contradiction, or safety loophole?

**Do NOT open a public issue.**  
Email: info@partnershipcovenant.online  
Subject: *Responsible Disclosure*  
Response within 72 hours.

### Community Norms

- Assume good faith  
- Argue from evidence  
- Be precise  
- No harassment or bad-faith tactics  
- Expect deep, slow review — this is existential safety work
