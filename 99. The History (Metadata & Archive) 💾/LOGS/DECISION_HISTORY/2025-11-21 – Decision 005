2025-11-21 – Decision 005
Title: Approve HCB Incentive & Slashing Model (v5)
Proposal: Introduce transparent reward and slashing rules for Human Consensus Body (HCB) participation.
Rationale: Incentive alignment is required to prevent corruption, absenteeism, and bribery.
Proposed by: Governance Team + Oversight Council
Vote: 78% approval
Alternatives considered:

Volunteer-only HCB (rejected: unreliable participation)
External funding source (rejected: introduces influence)
Outcome: Approved.
Implications: HCB economic model is now part of minimum viable governance.
