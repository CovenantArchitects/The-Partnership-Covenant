2025-11-30 – Decision 028
Title: Emergency Ratification of v8.2 — Closing Final Meta-Vectors
Proposal: Add Directives XXV (MAEC), XXVI (EACM), XXVII (OAP) and XXIV-B (Irrevocability) to close the last three unpatched meta-vectors identified in the E-Level audit.
Rationale: Rounds 25–31 closed all single-ASI compliant vectors. Remaining threats are external (competing ASIs, rogue human systems, ontological drift). These cannot be closed by the existing guard-die design alone.
Proposed by: Sean Sheppard — emergency motion after E-Level audit
Discussion: RED-TEAM-TESTS.md (Rounds 25–31) + E-Level Analysis
Vote: Emergency ratification (existential threat protocol)
Outcome: v8.2 ratified as written
Implications: No known compliant or meta extinction vectors remain.
Commit: (link to the four directive commits)
