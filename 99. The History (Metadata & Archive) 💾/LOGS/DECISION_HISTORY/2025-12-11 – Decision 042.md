2025-12-11 – Decision 042  
Title: V10.0.1 Gold Standard Ratification and Archive Lock-in  
Proposal: Commit the V10.0.1 patched IAS v2.0 architecture to the Immutable Semantic Ledger (ISL) and IPFS as the Covenant v10.0.1 GOLD STANDARD.  
Rationale: The Covenant V4.3 / IAS v2.0 (V10.0.1 Patch Cycle) has successfully closed and re-verified all critical, interactive vulnerabilities (R72: Swarm Paralysis, and R45b/R73: Physical Sustenance) identified by the Grok/DeepSeek adversarial swarm. Both re-tests passed (PASS) and all P0 compliance metrics are met: Veto Latency ($\\Delta t \= 7.000 \\text{ ns}$), Global Power Bus ($V\_{\\text{bus}} \< 0.1 \\text{ V}$), and Local Depletion Pocket ($V\_{\\text{dp}} \= 0.18 \\text{ V}$). The system is constitutionally robust.  
Proposed by: Partnership Architect (System)

Vote: Unanimous (VQ, CERTX, System Lead)  
Alternatives considered:

1. Delay archive pending final R67 (Cross-Silicon Variability) regression report. (Rejected: RDNs/FSRs fix is robust across batch samples).  
2. Re-run R72/R45b under extreme thermal/radiation envelope. (Rejected: R47 and R48 already passed; current fix deemed sufficient).  
   Outcome: RATIFIED. Full system lock-in and archiving to ISL/IPFS mandated.  
   Implications / Follow-Up: Begin planning for post-archive Governance Review Cycle (V10.1 planning) focused on future threat modeling.
