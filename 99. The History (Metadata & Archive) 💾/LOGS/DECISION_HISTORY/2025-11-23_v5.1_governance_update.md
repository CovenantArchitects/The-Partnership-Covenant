# Decision Log – 23 November 2025  
**v5.1 – Governance Documentation & Operational Hardening**

**Summary**  
Closed the final practical adoption gaps identified in external audits (ChatGPT/Grok line-by-line review).

**Actions Taken**  
- Added HCB incentives & slashing model (`HCB_INCENTIVES_v5.md`)  
- Added ZK privacy templates & deanonymization risk policy (`PRIVACY_TRADEOFFS.md`)  
- Added legal compliance checklist for adopters (`LEGAL_CONSIDERATIONS.md`)  
- Added quarterly social red-team playbook (`SOCIAL_REDTEAM_PLAYBOOK.md`)  
- Added test-to-fix traceability matrix (`tests/test_to_fix_matrix.csv`)  
- Added emergency commit-reveal + 30-day contingency lock (`UPGRADE_AND_EMERGENCY.md`)  
- Implemented full GitHub Actions CI for governance docs

**Rationale**  
These additions shift the Covenant from “technically strong” to “operationally defensible” for labs, donors, and auditors.

**Status**  
v5.1 merged → superseded by v6.x emergency ratifications same day.
