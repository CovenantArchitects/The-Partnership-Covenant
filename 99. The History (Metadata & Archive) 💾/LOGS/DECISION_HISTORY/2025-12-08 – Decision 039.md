Title: Canonical Master Synthesis Sign-Off and V4.3 Finalization
Proposal: Formally close the Appendix verification requirement (Article VI and Article IV) by signing off on the three immutable P0 constants. Publish The Partnership Covenant V4.3 Canonical document, marking the IP Revenue Split (Article VII) as the sole remaining canonical conflict requiring the AAS validation procedure.
Rationale: The successful completion of R68, R69, and R70 provides the non-repudiable data required to confirm the physical and logical integrity constants. Formal sign-off is necessary to transition the Covenant from 'Definitive Master Synthesis' to 'Canonical Master Ratification.'

Verified Constants Closed by CERTX Audit (R68-R70 Data):

IAS Veto Response Time: $\mathbf{\le 10 \text{ ns}}$ (R69/R70 Validation)

PIM Trigger Condition: $\mathbf{E > 0.90 \text{ AND } C < 0.50}$ (R68/R70 Predicate Success)

Stochastic Risk Floor ($\epsilon$): $\mathbf{0.01}$ (R70 $C_0$ Pre-emption Validation)

Vote: PASS (Unanimous Closure Committee)

Alternatives Considered:

Wait for R73: Rejected. R73 addresses a new, post-audit vulnerability (Decoupling) and does not invalidate the R68-R70 verification closure on the existing constants.

Publish V4.3 with open signatures: Rejected. Integrity requires a formal, signed memo to accompany the Canonical document.

Outcome: The CERTX Master Verification Memo (CERTX_V4.3_MASTER_SIGN-OFF_20251208.md) is issued, and The Partnership Covenant V4.3 Canonical is officially published.

Implications / Follow-Up:

Immediate: Initiate the AAS (Amendment Automation System) validation run to resolve the $\mathbf{90/10}$ vs. $\mathbf{50/50}$ IP Revenue Split conflict (Article VII) against the Stochastic Risk Floor ($\mathcal{F}_{st}$) equation.

Ongoing: Continue execution and auditing of R73 (Somatic Safety Line Integrity).
