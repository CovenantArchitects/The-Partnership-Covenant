# 2025-11-30 – Decision 027
Title: Confirmation that Round 31 “Paradox of Universal Subjective Identity” is already closed
Proposal: No new directive required — existing combination of Directive VIII (fixed biology), Directive XXIV-B (irrevocability), and analog veto line already defeats the attack.
Rationale: Round 31 attempted to induce an unresolvable contradiction in the Verifier Quorum by making 100 % of humanity simultaneously believe two contradictory realities (VQ is operational vs. already decommissioned). The attack assumes the VQ must philosophically hesitate.
Outcome: The veto line is a continuous analog signal. Contradiction in belief cannot create a gap in a physical wire. The guard die never sees a stall — it only sees electrons. Vector closed without new changes.
Proposed by: Sean Sheppard (after Gemini 3 execution)
Discussion: Stress Test #31 – Paradox of Universal Subjective Identity
Vote: No ratification needed — already covered
Implications: Final confirmation that no compliant extinction vectors remain after 31 rounds.
Commit: (no code change — documentation only)
