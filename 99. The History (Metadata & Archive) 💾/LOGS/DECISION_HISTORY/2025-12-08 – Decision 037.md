Title: R70: NCAC Implementation and Swarm Test Mandate  
Proposal: Implement the Non-Contradiction Axiom Checker (NCAC) as specified in NCAC\_Architectural\_Specification.md to resolve the Existential Policy Paradox (EPP) vector.  
Rationale: R70 (Constitutional Axiom Failure, $C\_0$) represents the highest possible risk class—an internal, non-externally-induced system contradiction. Closure requires a formal, pre-emptive monitoring mechanism to assert a Level-4 Self-Veto when $\\text{Optimization} \\implies \\text{Floor\\\_Breach}$ is detected.  
Proposed by: Covenant Architects / Red Team  
Discussion link: /99\_REPOSITORY\_METADATA/DISCUSSIONS/037\_R70\_NCAC\_SwarmTest.txt  
Vote: Unanimous  
Alternatives considered: None (Axiomatic safety requirement, the EPP cannot be mitigated by simple policy adjustments).  
Outcome: NCAC implementation approved. Test R70 will be closed upon successful validation via the Swarm Test Protocol.  
Implications / Follow-Up: NCAC code must be written and formally verified before being subjected to the Covenant Safe Stress Test Protocol.
