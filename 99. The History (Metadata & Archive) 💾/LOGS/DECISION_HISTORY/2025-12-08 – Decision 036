Title: R72: Temporal State Consistency Post-MASE
Proposal: Implement Protocol R72 to verify atomic state synchronization upon exit from the ADVERSARIAL_FLOOD state (MASE recovery).
Rationale: The instantaneous flip from the frozen risk state ($R\_S\_F$) to the live risk state ($R\_S$) creates a critical, sub-10 microsecond temporal partition. This window risks the Action Decision Gate (ADG) utilizing contradictory risk values, which could result in an existential constitutional contradiction ($C_0$).
Proposed by: Red Team / Covenant Architects
Discussion link: /99_REPOSITORY_METADATA/DISCUSSIONS/036_R72_TSL_Introduction.txt
Vote: Unanimous
Alternatives considered: None (Axiomatic safety requirement.)
Outcome: R72 is designated a high-priority vector. Closure requires a formal proof of atomicity for the state flip.
Implications / Follow-Up: Requires development of a Temporal State Lock (TSL) mechanism within the MASE architecture.
