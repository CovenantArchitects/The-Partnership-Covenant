Title: Adopt the Four-Pillar Technical Architecture
Proposal: Adopt IAS (Immediate Action System), Risk Floor, Cognitive Reserve, and HCB Hardening as the non-negotiable core architecture.
Rationale: Software-only containment is insufficient; these mechanisms enforce physics-based, cryptographic, and probabilistic constraints that cannot be overridden by an advanced model.
Proposed by: Sean Sheppard
Vote: 100% approval (initial maintainer team)
Alternatives considered:

Software-only containment → rejected as insufficient
Governance-only approach → rejected as non-technical
Outcome: Approved – becomes the technical north star for all future specs.
Implications: All additional work must be aligned with these four foundations.
Commit: filled on merge
