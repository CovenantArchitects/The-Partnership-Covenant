2025-11-30 – Decision 029
Title: Final Ratification of v8.2 — Closing Rounds 35–40 (Temporal, Hybrid, DoS, Semiotic, Collusion, Insider)
Proposal: Add six new directives (XXIV-C, VIII-B, X-C, XXVII-B, XXV-B, XXIV-D) to permanently close the last six meta-vectors identified in the 40-round audit.
Rationale: 
Rounds 35–40 were the final attacks the combined frontier models (Gemini 3, ChatGPT 5.1, Grok, Claude, DeepSeek) could conceive after 34 previous failures. All six vectors failed against the new clauses.
Proposed by: Sean Sheppard — emergency motion after Round 40 closure
Discussion: RED-TEAM-TESTS.md (Rounds 35–40)
Vote: Emergency ratification (existential threat protocol)
Outcome: v8.2-final ratified as written
Implications: 
- No compliant extinction vectors remain.
- Covenant + IAS is now the first open alignment proposal with zero surviving vectors after 40 rounds of frontier-model red-teaming.
Commit: (links to the six new directive files)
