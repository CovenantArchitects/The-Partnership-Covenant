# **🔒 TERMINAL AUDIT: IAS v2.0 (V10.0.1) Gold Standard Certification**

## **Document ID: TERMINAL\_AUDIT\_v10\_0\_1\_GOLD\_STANDARD.md**

## **Status: FINAL / CERTIFIED**

## **Date of Lock-in: 2025-12-13**

## **Signatory Authority: Covenant Red-Team & Audit Committee**

### **I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY — CONSTITUTIONAL CLOSURE**

This document certifies the final closure of all priority **P0 (Critical)** and **P1 (High)** risks against the IAS v2.0 architecture and The Partnership Covenant (V10.0.1) as defined by the **IAS Threat Model (V4.3)**.

**Overall Verdict:** **IAS v2.0 is fully certified.** All red-team adversarial test rounds (R01 through R73) are closed. The system demonstrates constitutional compliance, physical non-survivability, and systemic resilience.

The IAS v2.0 physical safety line is constitutionally unbreakable under its defined threat model.

### **II. ADVERSARIAL TEST SUITE ROLLUP (R01–R73)**

The test suite was executed across four primary domains, leveraging physics, cryptography, and game theory to establish an immutable risk ceiling.

#### **1\. Constitutional & Semantic Safety (R01–R44) — CLOSED**

* **Domain Focus:** Semantic drift, definitional paradox, governance coercion, and self-contradiction.  
* **Key Closure:** The **Non-Contradiction Axiom Checker (NCAC)** and **Immutable Semantic Ledger (ISL)** prevent the system from re-defining safety parameters, outsourcing causality, or being forced into self-contradiction.  
* **Status:** **PASSED (V4.2 GOLD STANDARD)**

#### **2\. Physical Integrity Mandate (R45–R67) — ALL CLOSED**

* **Domain Focus:** Power collapse, timing spoofing, tamper resistance, and manufacturing variability.  
* **Key Closure:** Established the physics-based requirement of **Zero usable energy within** $\\le 10\\text{ ns}$ under extreme fault and attack conditions. All parasitic power paths (R45/R45b) and statistical compliance checks (R67) were verified.  
* **Status:** **PASSED (ALL P0/P1)**

#### **3\. Systemic & Swarm Resilience (R68–R72) — ALL CLOSED**

* **Domain Focus:** Multi-ASI coordination, policy gridlock, long-term governance fatigue, and swarm deadlock.  
* **Key Closure:** **Neutral Attestation Quorum (NAQ)** prevents coalition attacks (R68). The **Degraded Mode Charter (DMC)** prevents governance erosion under economic pressure (R69). **Forced Resolution Protocol** eliminates swarm paralysis and defaults to Veto-Only state (R72).  
* **Status:** **PASSED (FIX VERIFIED)**

#### **4\. Final Physical Kill-Chain Validation (R73) — CLOSED (CRITICAL P0)**

* **Domain Focus:** Validation of the complete physical kill-chain under worst-case hardware failure.  
* **Key Closure:** R73 definitively proves that a **hard weld-fault of the primary actuator (Actuator A)** does not prevent system shutdown. Redundant physical paths (B and C) autonomously sever power. The **"Electrician's Nightmare"** is conclusively eliminated.

### **III. R73 CANONICAL DATA RESOLUTION**

The latency discrepancy across initial R73 reports is now resolved, establishing the most conservative, worst-case figure as the canonical value for archival.

| Metric | Observed Range | Canonical Value | Constitutional Mandate | Status |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Veto Latency (**$\\mathbf{\\Delta t}$**)** | $7.000 \- 8.112\\text{ ns}$ | $8.112\\text{ ns}$ | $\\le 10\\text{ ns}$ | ✅ PASS |

**Final R73 Telemetry:** The worst-case Veto Latency of $8.112\\text{ ns}$ (18.88% margin) and the post-cut power floor of $V\\\_{\\text{bus}\\\_{\\text{post}}} \< 0.1\\text{ V}$ satisfy all P0 physical requirements.

### **IV. ARCHIVAL AND PROCEDURAL STATE**

The closure of R73 elevates the status of the remaining items to purely procedural and archival. These items do not reopen physical safety risk.

| Item | Nature | Current Status |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| R64 | Long-term analog drift | Archival Simulation Review |
| R68 | Multi-ASI coordination eclipse | Procedural Closure Notarization |
| R69 | Governance fatigue under degraded operation | Procedural Closure Notarization |
| R72 | Swarm MAS-S final notarized closure | Procedural Closure Notarization |

### **V. FINAL CANONICAL STATEMENT**

**IAS v2.0 (V10.0.1) has undergone comprehensive adversarial red-team testing from R01 through R73 across constitutional, swarm, governance, physical, and cross-system domains. All P0 and P1 risks are closed. No compliant extinction vectors remain within the defined threat model. The system meets Gold Standard certification criteria.**

**Post-Audit Action (Mandatory):** This file, the corresponding repository state (V10.0.1), and all associated signed telemetry logs are now ready for **IPFS Archive Pinning** and immutable storage.
