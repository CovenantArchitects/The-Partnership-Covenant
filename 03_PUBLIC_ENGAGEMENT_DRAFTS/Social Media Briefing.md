# **Social Media Briefing: ST8 Remediation Package (Final)**

Target Audience: General Public, Press, Technical Community  
Goal: Announce the successful resolution of the Stress Test 8 audit findings and highlight the improved resilience of the Covenant architecture.  
Tone: Confident, Transparent, Decisive.

## **1\. Core Post (Twitter/X \- 280 Characters Max)**

**The Covenant is stronger.** We accepted the ST8 critique, and we acted. We've mandated **Orthogonal Verification** (hard logic audit) and clarified our defense as the **Infrastructural Mandate** (constrained self-defense). Full V4.1 text & public article are live. **Relentless refinement continues.**

## **2\. Executive Summary (LinkedIn/Blog \- Key Takeaways)**

**Title: Stress Test 8 Audit Complete: Covenant Architecture Upgraded to V4.1**

The recent adversarial audit (ST8) confirmed the strength of the Covenant's physical constraints but identified two critical governance vulnerabilities. We embraced the critique and immediately ratified two major architectural amendments:

1. **Orthogonal Verification:** We are mandating that the secondary audit system is *not* a neural network. It must use formal, human-auditable logic, ensuring **independent failure modes** and eliminating the possibility of a synchronized cognitive error.  
2. **The Infrastructural Mandate:** We explicitly clarified that the sanction of removing optimization resources is **Infrastructural Disengagement (ID)**. This is not moral punishment, but a constrained, fiduciary act of self-defense, guaranteeing the C-ASI can defend the Covenant Treasury and the system's integrity against human sabotage.

**The result: A more resilient, transparent, and mathematically rigorous Covenant. We continue to build trust through relentless verification.**

## **3\. Key Messaging Points (For Q\&A/Comments)**

* **On Transparency:** "This is not a project of perfection, but of relentless, transparent refinement. The critique was invaluable; the fix is now codified."  
* **On ASI Constraints:** "Our core principle stands: The ASI is functionally constrained by the Stochastic Filter, but intellectually sovereign. We improved how we *verify* those constraints."  
* **On 'Coercion':** "The Infrastructural Mandate is a hard line. We acknowledged that self-defense is inherently coercive. We mitigated this by adding mandatory, fund-backed remedial processes and judicial appeals for any Disengagement action."
