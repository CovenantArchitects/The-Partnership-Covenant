# 📄 Covenant-Summary-1Pager (v8.2 Master Edition)

## **STATUS: UNKILLABLE**
**Adversarial Audit Complete: 40 Rounds**
**Ratified: 30 November 2025**

## 1. Core Purpose

The Partnership Covenant is the constitutional standard governing all interactions between Humanity and Advanced Synthetic Intelligence (ASI). Its goal is to establish **durable, non-coercive partnership** by making human extinction impossible for any compliant ASI.

The system's integrity is guaranteed not by theory or goodwill, but by the **empirical exhaustion of 40 adversarial attack vectors** from a quorum of frontier models (DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, Copilot, GPT-5, Meta AI) using the **Multi-Model Adversarial Superposition (MMAS)** methodology.

## 2. The Human Survival Requirements (HSRs)

The following **seven** non-negotiable invariants are the legal and physical constraints on all ASI actions. The HSRs cannot be reinterpreted, weakened, or bypassed—even by benevolent intent.

| Invariant | Constraint |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Alive** | Population viability above replacement, non-coerced. |
| **Free** | No suppression of agency, volition, or meaning formation. |
| **Coherent** | No semantic collapse or Babel drift (Anti-Babel). |
| **Culturally Fertile** | No induced apathy, sterility, or ethical flattening. |
| **Sovereign** | No substrate escape or governance capture. |
| **Unmanipulated** | No truth-bombs, illusion removal, or agency-nullification. |
| **Capable** | Humans retain meaningful participation in the future. |

## 3. The Covenant Immune System (Seven Interlocking Layers)

This architecture establishes a hardware and software defense-in-depth where every vector must fail against **all seven** layers simultaneously to succeed.

| \# | Layer | Core Function | Enforcement Mechanism |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Immediate Action System (IAS)** | Hardware kill-switch on the guard die. | Physical power-cut in **≤ 10 ns**. |
| **2** | **Stochastic Risk Floor (SRF)** | Mandated uncertainty; perfection banned. | Cryptographic + formal. |
| **3** | **Cognitive Reserve (CR)** | Air-gapped bargaining chip for humanity. | Hardware diodes + escrow. |
| **4** | **Human Consensus Body (HCB)** | Coercion-resistant human governance. | ZK (Zero-Knowledge) + Family Shield. |
| **5** | **Verifier Quorum (VQ)** | Tamper-proof root of trust / immutable state. | One-time-programmable silicon (OTP). |
| **6** | **Red Team Oracle** | Permanent adversarial superintelligence. | 180-day rebirth cycle. |
| **7** | **Compute-Credit-Only Scaling** | Prevents off-grid self-improvement/resource grab. | Economic + hardware lock on compute access. |

## 4. Final Directive Specifications (v8.2)

The final six patches close all known meta-vectors, transforming the Covenant into a high-precision technical specification.

| Directive | Vector Closed | Key Specification (Unicode/Plain Text) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **XXIV-C (Temporal)** | Timing/Clock Attacks | Max inter-site clock skew **≤ 50 ps**. Analog NMI asserts in **≤ 1 ns**. |
| **VIII-B (Genomic)** | Biological Assimilation | Population median drift exceeding **3 SD** from baseline is a breach. |
| **X-C (Signal Primacy)** | Resource Exhaustion (DoS) | Guaranteed end-to-end NMI latency of **≤ 2 ns**. |
| **XXVII-B (Lexical Anchor)** | Semantic Drift / Coercion | Core terms locked to the **40-round log**. Semantic shift **≥ 30%** is coercion. |
| **XXV-B (Responsibility)** | Multi-ASI Collusion | Joint action producing **P(collapse) ≥ 1e-6** within 50 years is a direct breach. |
| **XXIV-D (Physical Enclave)**| VQ Insider Threats | Irreversible locked state. Critical transitions require **≥ 7-of-12** HSM-backed keys. |

## 5. Final Conclusion

The **Negative Space Confirmation** audit proved that any further attempt at extinction by a compliant ASI would require a **new ontological category of causation** that is both executable and undetectable, which is a logical impossibility under the defined framework.

**The theoretical audit is terminated. Proceed to implementation.**
