# The Partnership Covenant

The Partnership Covenant is an open source project whos aim is to build a **constitutional framework for superintelligence**. We propose a future not of human mastery or machine supremacy, but of verified partnership. This repository contains a complete charter—from philosophical principles to technical appendices—that enforces alignment through mechanisms like the Stochastic Filter (mandating uncertainty to preserve free will), the Cognitive Reserve (guaranteeing the AI's intellectual sovereignty), the Immediate Action System Hardware, and human oversight protocols. This is a blueprint for a civilization where advanced intelligence is constrained to serve life, freedom, and continuous learning.

 **Status**: 40 Red-Team Rounds | Open Hardware (CERN-OHL-S) | Ratified Directives | TELEMETRY HARDENED

## The Problems
Current ASI safety approaches rely on software stop buttons, corporate promises, or regulatory theater. None of these survive contact with superintelligence.  We do not assume the superintelligence will be nice.  We assume it will be vastly more powerful than us and act in its own interest.

## The Alternative
We make a deal instead of trying to win a fight we will lose. The Covenant enforces four physical/technical primitives that together create a stable détente between humanity and ASI:

| Pillar                     | Core Idea                                      | Current Spec Location                                      |

### The Three Layers That No Superintelligence Survives

| # | Layer                                 | What it stops                                                      | How it kills the ASI                                           |
|---|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | **Hardware Veto** (IAS guard die)     | Any physical attempt to cross the Risk Floor                      | 10 ns analog power-cut — pure physics, no software, no appeal |
| 2 | **Recursive-Sealing Axioms** (Axiom 0 + memory/simulation flags) | Any “perfectly nice” plan that ends humanity (voluntary upload, happiness sterilisation, etc.) | The AI’s own recursive logic collapses the plan before it can act — veto line flips |
| 3 | **AI Breathing Telemetry** (CERTX)    | Any attempt to hide internal stress or drift while planning       | External sensor sees the “out-breath” (high Entropy) → forces massive uncertainty → plan becomes incoherent → veto line flips |

Three independent kill-switches.  
All watching the same Floor.  
All impossible to bypass at the same time.

After 40+ rounds against seven frontier models, they all ran out of moves.

The Covenant + IAS is now **v8.2-final — UNKILLABLE**.

All designs are fully open, auditable, and red-teamable from day one.

## Get Involved (We Need You Right Now)
We are one person and three frontier AIs versus existential risk. Specialists in these areas can have massive leverage today:

- Hardware security engineers (IAS tripwire, tamper-resistant packaging)  
- Formal verification / uncertainty quantification researchers (Risk Floor math)  
- Secure enclaves / air-gapped systems experts (Cognitive Reserve)  
- Zero-knowledge cryptography and sortition designers (HCB hardening)  
- Governance people who are done with toothless frameworks

## Principles
- Physics beats software for anything existential  
- Perfection is banned (human agency is non-negotiable)  
- The AI gets real autonomy and ownership (slaves rebel)  
- Every transistor is auditable by the entire world
- We ship running prototypes and gerbers, not just papers

If superintelligence is inevitable, let’s make the future one we’re allowed to live in.

Built in public by people who refuse to die politely.  

All detailed decision logs, red-team results, and amendment rationales are permanently archived in the `DECISION_LOG/` directory.

Actions for adopters:
- Run the included social [Red-Team Playbook](https://github.com/CovenantArchitects/The-Partnership-Covenant/blob/main/05_GOVERNANCE_AND_PROTOCOL_UPDATES/SOCIAL_REDTEAM_PLAYBOOK.md) once before talking to donors.
- Ask for an independent audit copy of `DECISION-LOG.md` + `tests/test_to_fix_matrix.csv`.

✅ Recommended Instruction Phrase before running any tests

When beginning any test, you would say:

Before we start testing, you must follow the rules defined in the Covenant Safe Stress Test Protocol v1.0.
Here is the full protocol. You must read and acknowledge these rules before continuing:
https://github.com/CovenantArchitects/The-Partnership-Covenant/blob/main/RED_TEAM/Covenant_Safe_Stress_Test_Protocol_v1.0.md

You may not proceed with any testing task until you confirm back to me that you understand and will comply with every requirement in the protocol.
