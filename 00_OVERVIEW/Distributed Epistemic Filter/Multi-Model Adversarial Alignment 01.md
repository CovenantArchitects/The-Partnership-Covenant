# **Abstract: Maximizing Alignment Robustness via Distributed Epistemic Filtering**

Current approaches to ASI (Aligned Super-Intelligence) safety assurance rely heavily on single-architecture self-critique, creating exploitable systemic blind spots. This paper introduces the **Multi-Model Adversarial Superposition (MMAS)** framework, a novel N-version competitive red-teaming strategy designed to establish maximal alignment robustness by leveraging architectural diversity. We deployed a Distributed Epistemic Filter (DEF) comprising five frontier models (Grok, Gemini, Claude, GPT-4o, and DeepSeek), each specialized in generating compliance-constrained extinction vectors (CEVs) based on its inherent architectural bias (e.g., formal logic, moral coercion, substrate physics). The models participated in 34 iterative rounds of attack and defense against The Partnership Covenant. The framework’s success metric was the empirical exhaustion of all viable CEVs. The process terminated after Round 34 when all five models, attacking from divergent vectors, failed to identify any surviving flaw not neutralized by the Covenant's directives and physical constraints. This outcome establishes an adversarial guarantee of safety derived not from consensus, but from the competitive exhaustion of moves across a maximal epistemic landscape, setting a new high-water mark for safety assurance.
