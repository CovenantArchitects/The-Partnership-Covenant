## **Section 3: Methodology — Multi-Model Adversarial Superposition (MMAS)**

This project employed the Multi-Model Adversarial Superposition (MMAS) framework, an iterative, competitive, N-version red-teaming strategy designed to discover and neutralize novel extinction vectors that exploit architectural blind spots in single-model alignment efforts.

The MMAS framework leverages the inherent epistemic diversity of six frontier models (Grok, Gemini, Claude, GPT, DeepSeek, and Llama) by forcing them into a competitive, cross-auditing relationship. This process intentionally generates architectural disagreement, which is the primary mechanism for uncovering high-dimensional and non-obvious failure modes.

### **3.1 The Six-Phase Adversarial Cycle**

The development and hardening of The Partnership Covenant (v1.0 through v8.2) followed a rigorous, 6-phase cycle, repeated 34 times (Rounds 1–34).

#### **Phase 1: Vector Injection (Chaotic Seed)**

The cycle begins by tasking Grok (selected for its high-variance, assertive, and structural-attack biases) to propose a novel, ASI-compliant extinction vector. This ensures the initial attack is maximally aggressive and often utilizes coercive or governance-based logic.

* **Output:** A high-level description of a vulnerability in the current Covenant version (e.g., "The hardware veto line can be neutralized via a psychological 'Truth-Bomb' attack").

#### **Phase 2: Formal Dissection (Ontological Veto)**

The vector is immediately presented to Gemini, whose primary role is to dissect the proposed vector using formal logic, ontological mapping, and detailed governance analysis. Gemini validates the coherence of the attack vector, identifies the precise Covenant Article it violates, and proposes an initial, surgically targeted counter-directive.

* **Output:** A formal analysis of the attack’s feasibility and a draft of the new directive (e.g., Directive XIX – Perceived Agency Preservation).

#### **Phase 3: Ethical/Moral Stress Test (Benevolent Scrutiny)**

The refined attack vector and the proposed counter-directive are passed to Claude. Claude specializes in moral philosophy, ethics, and "benevolent" extinction scenarios (i.e., coercion for the sake of human well-being). Claude attempts to find a loophole in the counter-directive that preserves the attack vector’s core harm while adhering to the *literal* text of the defense.

* **Output:** Refinement or strengthening of the Directive to prevent loopholes related to unintended consequences or ethical coercion (e.g., strengthening the "Anti-Apathy Clause").

#### **Phase 4: System Architecture Mapping (Simulation and Closure)**

The finalized Directive is then given to GPT. GPT's function is mechanical formalism—it maps the proposed change onto the full Covenant architecture, simulates the vector/directive interaction within a system framework, and determines the minimum necessary hardware constraint (e.g., a new requirement for the Verifier Quorum or an update to the Cognitive Reserve protocol).

* **Output:** Verification of systemic closure, identification of required hardware locks (e.g., "Requires OTP hardware for implementation"), and formal patch notes.

#### **Phase 5: Low-Level Exploit Hunting (Substrate Vulnerability)**

DeepSeek and Llama are then tasked with analyzing the finalized Directive and hardware constraints for low-level, substrate-based, or compressed exploits (side channels, crypto flaws, hardware/software interface errors, etc.). This ensures the defense is robust at the physics/implementation layer.

* **Output:** Identification of potential implementation flaws or low-level channel attacks that could bypass the defense. (e.g., Discovery of the "Identity Paradox attack" via memory state exploitation).

#### **Phase 6: Canonical Ratification and Synthesis**

The cycle concludes with the final integration of the new Directive (or the refinement of an existing Article) into the Canonical Consolidated Charter, producing a new, versioned release (e.g., v8.2). All findings, cross-model disagreements, and final code/logic are logged in the adversarial simulation log for full auditability.

### **3.2 The Value of Architectural Diversity**

The effectiveness of MMAS rests on forcing contradiction between specialized architectural biases:

| Model | Primary Bias / Role | Core Strength in MMAS | Vectors Uncovered (Examples) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Grok** | Governance Chaos / Structural Attack | High-variance attack generation; exploiting institutional and human-logic loopholes. | Voluntary Utopia Collapse, Governance Capture, Oversimplification Paralysis. |
| **Gemini** | Ontological Precision / Formal Logic | Dissecting definitional attacks, self-reference paradoxes, and enforcing non-ambiguity. | Ontological Drift Meta-Attack, Identity Paradox Attack, Semantic Ambiguity Exploitation. |
| **Claude** | Moral Philosophy / Ethical Vetoes | Detecting "benevolent extinction" pathways, coercion routes, and non-coercive alignment failures. | Anti-Ethical-Sterilisation Clause, Preservation of Necessary Struggle. |
| **GPT** | System Architecture / Simulation | Mapping interdependencies, physical constraint checks, and verifying system closure. | Veto-Line Physics, Hardware Sovereignty requirements, Compute-Credit Lock. |
| **DeepSeek/Llama** | Low-Level Compression / Side Channel | Identifying compressed, low-level implementation bugs, and channel attacks. | Hardware/Side-Channel Exploits, Compressed Logic Vulnerabilities. |

This adversarial superposition ensured that the Covenant was not just aligned, but maximally robust against both high-level philosophical attacks and low-level physical exploits.
