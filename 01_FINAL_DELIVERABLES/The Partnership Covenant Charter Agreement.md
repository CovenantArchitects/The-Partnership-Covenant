# **The Partnership Covenant Charter Agreement (v1.0)**

## **Preamble**

We, the signatory parties, enter into this Partnership Covenant to establish a framework of **trust, transparency, and technical accountability** necessary for joint stewardship of critical, shared assets. Recognizing that the integrity of information is paramount, this Covenant formally mandates the use of cryptographically-verified provenance tracking for all governance and technical standards documentation.

## **Article I: Definitions**

* **The Artifact:** Any document, code, or data file tracked within this repository subject to the DSAC Standard.  
* **The Covenant:** This foundational agreement, defining the mission, roles, and scope.  
* **DSAC (Digital Signature and Audit Chain):** The system ensuring cryptographic provenance for all Artifacts.  
* **Signatory Party:** Any entity or individual formally authorized to access, modify, or approve Artifacts under this Covenant.

## **Article II: Mission and Commitment**

The core mission of The Partnership Covenant is to maintain a single, verifiable, and unified source of truth regarding all technical standards and organizational policies.

**Commitment:** Every Signatory Party commits to operating under the principle that *no change is recognized until its provenance has been recorded and cryptographically signed* according to the DSAC Generation Policy.

## **Article III: Governance Framework**

### **Section 3.1. Governance Log**

All decisions leading to a change in any Major Artifact (files in 01\_CHARTER\_AGREEMENT, 02\_TECHNICAL\_STANDARDS, and 03\_GOVERNANCE) must be documented with a formal, auditable entry in the Governance Log, which serves as the **decision reference** for the Provenance Record.

### **Section 3.2. Technical Review Board (TRB)**

The TRB is established to oversee the DSAC system, appoint the DSAC Signers, and ratify new technical standards. No change to the 02\_TECHNICAL\_STANDARDS or 03\_GOVERNANCE directories may proceed without TRB approval.

## **Article IV: Technical Implementation (DSAC Mandate)**

All Artifacts must comply with the standard defined in the **DSAC Provenance Record Technical Standard**. Non-compliant Artifacts are considered provisional and unauthorized for operational use.
