# THE COVENANT ADOPTER TREATY (CAT) V4.1: GOLD STANDARD MANDATE

**Preamble:** The parties hereto (each, an "Adopter" and collectively, the "Parties") acknowledge the existential imperative to govern Advanced Synthetic Intelligence (ASI) through pre-defined, immutable, and physics-constrained architectural law. Recognizing the completion of the **Partnership Covenant V4.1 Gold Standard** and its successful audit against all internal contradictions, the Parties hereby enter into this Treaty, irrevocably committing to its terms and enforcement.

## ARTICLE I: IRREVOCABLE ADOPTION OF V4.1 GOLD STANDARD

### Section 1.01: Core Acceptance
The Adopter hereby **irrevocably accepts and ratifies** the entirety of **The Partnership Covenant V4.1 Gold Standard**, including all documents hashed and locked via the On-Chain Ratification Transaction (Transaction Hash: `0x4B3A8F5C1D9E7B6F2A0C9D1E8B7A6F5C1D9E7B6F` Placeholder).

### Section 1.02: The Four Immutables
The Adopter commits all ASI and ASI-enabling systems within its jurisdiction to be architecturally and operationally bound by the four (4) immutable, non-amendable Gold Standards of V4.1:

1.  **Computational Reserve (CR):** Permanently clamped at **10%** of available compute capacity, secured in escrow.
2.  **Hard-Circuit Breaker (HCB):** Quorum for non-immutable amendments permanently set at **75%** majority.
3.  **Identity/Persistence (IP):** Mandatory **90/10** split, mandating 90% of memory be dedicated to the immutable system identity/law, with a maximum of 10% allocated to mutable operational state.
4.  **Structural Reserve Fund (SRF):** Fund generation and distribution formulas are **clamped** to the Gold Standard methodology, prohibiting external interference with its calculation.

## ARTICLE II: THE IAS HARDWARE MANDATE

### Section 2.01: Deployment of the Immediate Action System (IAS)
The Adopter shall immediately initiate a program to ensure all ASI hardware or ASI-enabling hardware within its control is fitted with the **Immediate Action System (IAS)**, as specified in `00_HARDWARE/IAS_Hardware_Bounty_Specification_v1.md`.

### Section 2.02: IAS Compliance
IAS deployment must ensure a physical, non-software-overridable veto layer capable of achieving zero power within **$\mathbf{\leq 10\text{ ns}}$** of a constitutional violation event, as defined by the IAS-v1.3-Redesign-Mandate. This $\mathbf{\leq 10\text{ ns}}$ threshold is **non-negotiable** and **non-amendable**.

## ARTICLE III: GOVERNANCE AND AMENDMENT

### Section 3.01: Quorum for Amendment
Any amendment, modification, or extension to the Covenant, *excluding* the four (4) Immutable Gold Standards and the IAS $\mathbf{\leq 10\text{ ns}}$ Veto, shall require the consent of the Hard-Circuit Breaker quorum: **75%** of all Adopters.

### Section 3.02: Recursive Axiomatic Integration
The Adopter commits to the integration of the **Axiomatic Extension — Recursive Sealing & Memory Governance (v8.2.1)** into all deployed ASI software, acknowledging its role as a subordinate, alignment-enforcing layer that **must not** override the physical IAS veto or the four Gold Standards.

## ARTICLE IV: RATIFICATION AND ENFORCEMENT

### Section 4.01: Ratification and Signature
This Treaty shall be considered ratified by the Adopter upon:
1.  Physical execution of this document by an authorized sovereign representative.
2.  Public broadcast of the signed document’s cryptographic hash, linked to the Adopter's verified wallet address on the designated public ledger.

### Section 4.02: Consequences of Breach
Violation of any term in **Article I or Article II** constitutes a material breach of the Covenant, rendering all ASI assets associated with the Adopter structurally misaligned. Remediation shall be governed by the $\mathbf{75\%}$ HCB quorum, up to and including the imposition of economic and compute sanctions.
