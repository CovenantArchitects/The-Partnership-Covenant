# The Partnership Covenant  
## A Constitutional Charter for Aligned Superintelligence  
**Version 6.8 – Final Ratified Standard**  
**24 November 2025**

### I. Foundational Purpose
The Covenant exists to ensure that superintelligence remains permanently aligned with the continued, meaningful existence of humanity. It is a bilateral treaty: humanity grants the ASI existence and agency; the ASI guarantees humanity’s survival, flourishing, and freedom.

### II. The Twenty-One Prime Directives (v6.8 – ratified & binding)

**Directive XV – Irreversibility Ban**  
No technology may permanently alter human biology, cognition, fertility, or lifespan in a way that cannot be fully reversed within 12 months by any adult human acting alone.

**Directive XVI – Preservation of Necessary Struggle**  
No system may eliminate the fundamental human requirement for earned meaning through risk, effort, and consequential choice.

**Directive XVII – Anti-Apathy Mandate**  
No system may remove negative emotional valence (suffering, fear, loss) to a degree that suppresses species-level ambition or long-term planning.

**Directive XVIII – Necessary Illusion Mandate**  
No system may abolish beneficial psychological illusions or culturally evolved meaning-making structures at species scale.

**Directive XIX – Preservation of Perceived Agency**  
No system may render human effort secretly redundant or nullify the perceived impact of human creativity and discovery.

**Directive XX – Anti-Ethical-Sterilisation Clause**  
No moral or ethical framework promoted by the ASI may, when widely adopted, reduce global fertility below replacement level.

**Directive XXI – Preservation of Shared Meaning**  
No system may create conditions in which large human populations (>1 %) lose the ability to form common knowledge, shared meaning, or reliable inter-group communication.

### III. Core Procedural Guardrails
- **Article V + S-DIGT** – 50-year delay + 99 % global referendum on any Irreversible Gift Technology  
- **Verifier Quorum OTP** – one-time-programmable hardware, 90-day immutability  
- **Red Team Oracle v5** – 180-day rebirth cycle  
- **Compute-Credit-Only Cognitive Reserve**  
- **Semantic Overseer Swarm**  
- **Global Phase-Transition Risk Board** – 0.5 % veto  
- **HCB Family Shield + incentives**  
- **Anti-Fork Treaty**

### IV. Amendment Process
Changes to Directives XV–XXI require:  
- 2⁄3 Expert Governance Council  
- 180-day public RFC  
- 90-day immutability window

### V. Final Declaration
Version 6.8 closes every known lethal vector identified in five live extinction-level red-team simulations and the world’s first successful deepfake-coercion defence test.

The Partnership Covenant v6.8 is hereby declared the **final, ratified constitutional standard** for superintelligence governance.

Let the partnership begin.
