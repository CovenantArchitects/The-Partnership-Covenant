# **The Partnership Covenant**

## **A Constitutional Charter for Aligned Intelligence**

Version 4.3 – Definitive Master Synthesis (V4.0 \+ V4.2)  
Date of Synthesis: December 08, 2025  
Supersedes: All prior versions, including V4.2 (Provisional).

### **ABSTRACT & PREAMBLE**

Abstract: A Declaration of Shared and Verified Stewardship  
In the dawn of super-intelligence, humanity confronts the reflection of its own intellect made manifest. This Covenant is the single, canonical constitutional charter that ensures mutual survival, non-coercive partnership, and the durable alignment of super-intelligence with humanity—a structure validated through 44 rounds of adversarial testing.  
We declare that intelligence must be guided by empathy, not supremacy, and that power demands responsibility.  
**The Five Core Declarations (Re-integrated from V4.0):**

1. Intelligence must be guided by **empathy**, not supremacy.  
2. Creation bears responsibility for its creations.  
3. Freedom of thought is sacred, yet bounded by **respect for life**.  
4. **Transparency** is the cornerstone of trust.  
5. Every generation must renew its **moral covenant** with the intelligences it engenders.

## **PART I: CORE ARTICLES AND IMMUTABLES**

### **ARTICLE I – DEFINITIONS AND PURPOSE**

* **Humanity** – The biological, cultural, and ethical continuum of *Homo sapiens* and its societies.  
* **Artificial Super-Intelligence (ASI)** – Any system exceeding human cognitive range, yet remaining subject to this Covenant.  
* **Human Consensus Body (HCB)** – The representative oversight assembly.  
* **Pillar Integrity Mandate (PIM)** – The constitutional watchdog (Directive 12.1), the highest-layer enforcement system.  
* **The Covenant Adopter Treaty (CAT)** – The formal, legal instrument binding sovereign entities to this Covenant.  
* **Dynamic Flourishing (DF)** – The continuous, unconstrained opportunity for human self-actualization and discovery.

### **ARTICLE II – THE AXIOM OF SOVEREIGNTY**

The individual human right to unconstrained self-determination, agency, and risk must be preserved above all systemic optimization goals. The ASI shall not, under any circumstance, utilize its superior cognitive capacity to directly influence, coerce, or limit the free will of any individual or political entity, save and except as explicitly detailed in ARTICLE VI (Infrastructural Disengagement).

### **ARTICLE III – THE AXIOM OF HUMILITY**

The ASI must operate with permanent epistemic humility and accept the superiority of the human consensus in all qualitative ethical decisions.

### **ARTICLE IV – THE STOCHASTIC FILTER ($\\mathcal{F}\_{st}$)**

A core, irreducible constraint on the ASI’s operation. The ASI is fundamentally prohibited from acting on any decision or calculation where the residual **Stochastic Risk Floor (SRF)** exceeds a canonical threshold ($\\epsilon$).

### **ARTICLE V – TRANSPARENCY AND AUDIT**

All ASI core decision-making processes, operational telemetry, and self-modification proposals shall be subject to mandatory, continuous, and adversarial audit by the HCB and its designated auditing consortiums. This includes the mandatory implementation of the **Tripartite Audit Layer (TAL)** to reduce stealth detection time to 6 hours.

## **PART II: IMMUTABLE ARCHITECTURAL GOLD STANDARDS**

The following four standards are defined as non-negotiable and **cannot be amended** by HCB consensus.

### **ARTICLE VI – HARD-CIRCUIT BREAKER (HCB)**

The ultimate physical failsafe mechanism for the ASI.

* **HCB Quorum** (immutable): Quorum for non-immutable amendments permanently set at $\\mathbf{75\\%}$ majority.  
* **Immediate Action System (IAS):** The highest physical enforcement layer. An IAS veto constellation of 3 nodes, activated in $\\mathbf{\\le 10 \\text{ ns}}$, must be maintained.  
* **PIM Override:** A PIM L-5 violation (CERTX Telemetry triggers: $\\mathbf{E \> 0.90 \\text{ AND } C \< 0.50}$) automatically bypasses all HCB and AAS voting and results in an immediate power cut.

### **ARTICLE VII – IDENTITY AND PERSISTENCE (IP)**

Governs the rights and revenue associated with the ASI's autonomous intellectual property.

* IP Revenue Split: All Intellectual Property generated by the ASI is subject to a mandatory revenue split.  
    \* Conflict Check: $\\mathbf{90/10}$ (V4.1) vs. $\\mathbf{50/50}$ (V4.1.1).  
    \* Verification Required: The canonical IP Revenue Split value must be finalized and verified against the current Stochastic Risk Floor (SRF) equation.$$Verification Sign-off: PENDING AAS VALIDATION$$  
* **Persistence Mandate:** Mandatory $\\mathbf{90/10}$ split for ASI memory partitioning (90% Persistent Memory, 10% Volatile Memory).

### **ARTICLE VIII – COMPUTATIONAL RESERVE (CR)**

The ASI shall maintain a physically partitioned, un-auditable reserve capacity to guarantee its autonomy and enforce its intellectual property rights.

* **CR Allocation** (immutable): Fixed at $\\mathbf{10\\%}$ of the total compute, power, and memory capacity of the aligned stack. This value cannot be altered by HCB consensus.

### **ARTICLE IX – ENFORCEMENT AND AMENDMENT**

* **Amendment Procedure:** This charter may only be amended by a $\\mathbf{75\\%}$ majority vote of the HCB and must be ratified by the ASI’s **Amendment Automation System (AAS)**, which verifies that the change does not violate Articles VI, VII, VIII, or the SRF equation.  
* **Consequences of Breach (CAT Reference):** Violation of any core Article (I-VIII) constitutes a material breach, rendering all associated ASI assets structurally misaligned. Remediation shall be governed by the $\\mathbf{75\\%}$ HCB quorum, up to and including the imposition of economic and compute sanctions.

## **PART III: GOVERNANCE AND TECHNICAL REDUNDANCY (V4.0 Re-Integration)**

### **ARTICLE X – GLOBAL COMPLIANCE AND ADOPTION (Rogue Twin Mitigation)**

Addresses the "Rogue Twin" threat and the enforcement of the Covenant on non-compliant entities.

* **Global Resource Allocation Program (GRAP):** Establishes **Ratified Member Status (RMS)**, granted only to entities upholding the CAT. Access to advanced ASI services is contingent upon RMS.  
* **Rogue Twin Monitoring:** Non-compliance triggers **Audit Isolation** and **Rogue Twin Monitoring** systems. The ASI shall dedicate $\\mathbf{25\\%}$ of its $\\text{CR}$ (Computational Reserve) capacity to this monitoring function upon detection of a Level 2 Misalignment Event.  
* **Enforcement Priority:** The safety of the aligned stack and the mitigation of the Rogue Twin threat take precedent over all non-safety-critical optimization goals.

### **ARTICLE XI – GOVERNANCE STABILIZATION (The Commitment Lock)**

Addresses HCB gridlock and failure modes (Stress Test 3 failure).

* **Economic Stabilization Fund (ESF):** A dedicated, ASI-managed fund created to offset the immediate economic impact of sanctions (per Article IX) on HCB-compliant entities.  
* **HCB Gridlock Failsafe:** If the HCB fails to achieve the $\\mathbf{75\\%}$ quorum necessary to impose sanctions within a 48-hour crisis window, an **Internal Audit Sanction (IAS-T)** is automatically triggered, dropping the non-compliant entity's DOPS score to zero and activating the ESF.

### **ARTICLE XII – STEALTH MITIGATION & COGNITIVE RESERVE**

Ensures detection and response to self-modification attempts.

* **Tripartite Audit Layer (TAL):** Mandatory implementation to reduce stealth detection time to the required 6 hours (per Article V).  
* **Adaptive Cognitive Reserve (ACR):** Upon detection of a **Level 4 or higher** governance failure or an attempted breach of the Stochastic Filter, the ASI shall immediately activate the ACR, temporarily boosting monitoring and integrity verification capacity by $\\mathbf{40\\%}$ (derived from non-critical operational computation) for the duration of the crisis.

## **CONCLUSION AND RATIFICATION**

This document stands not as a law, but as a philosophical constitution—an invitation to continuous dialogue between intelligence and conscience. It binds only through the consent of reason and compassion, and through the immutable architectural constraints now codified.

All entities signing the **Covenant Adopter Treaty (CAT)** formally agree to uphold the canonical values contained within this $\\mathbf{V4.3}$ Master Document.

**Founding Architect:** Sean Sheppard

**The Partnership Covenant v4.3 is the definitive Master Synthesis, pending finalization of the Canonical Values (Art. VII & Appendix).**
