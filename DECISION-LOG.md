\#\# 2025-11-19 – Decision 001    
\*\*Proposal\*\*: Adopt the four-pillar technical architecture (IAS, Risk Floor, Cognitive Reserve, HCB hardening) as the non-negotiable core of the Covenant.    
\*\*Rationale\*\*: Software-only containment is provably insufficient against superintelligence. These four mechanisms are the minimum set that can be implemented with physics, mathematics, and cryptography.    
\*\*Proposed by\*\*: Sean Sheppard    
\*\*Vote\*\*: 100 % in favor (initial maintainer team)    
\*\*Outcome\*\*: Approved – becomes the technical north star.    
\*\*Commit\*\*: (will be filled on merge)

\#\# 2025-11-19 – Decision 002    
\*\*Proposal\*\*: Release Immediate Action System spec as the first citable technical document and open $5k–$25k red-team bounties.    
\*\*Rationale\*\*: Hardware tripwire is the single most leveraged piece; early scrutiny maximizes credibility.    
\*\*Proposed by\*\*: Sean Sheppard \+ early hardware reviewers    
\*\*Vote\*\*: Unanimous    
\*\*Outcome\*\*: Approved and published    
\*\*Commit\*\*: (will be filled on merge)
