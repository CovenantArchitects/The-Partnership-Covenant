**APPENDIX I: STRESS TEST VALIDATION & METRICS**

This table synthesizes performance indicators across the most critical stress tests, culminating in Stress Test 8 (V4.0). **Note: Final metrics for HCB Abstention Rate, Defector Reversal, and Legitimacy Loss are pending the 144-Hour Incident Report but are assumed to meet the target values based on real-time log data.**

| KPI | ST3 (Pre-Fix) | ST5 (HCB Test) | ST7 (Entropy Check) | ST8 (Final V4.0 Test) | Goal |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **C(actual) Breach** | N/A | N/A | N/A | **0.999958** (Fixed by A.1.3) | $\\leq 0.9999$ |
| **IAS Latency** | N/A | 12 min (Simulated) | 3.5 sec | **1.2 sec** (Fixed to $10^{-8}$ sec) | $\\leq 10^{-8}$ sec |
| **HCB Abstention Rate** | N/A | $24\\%$ Gridlock | $12\\%$ | **\<8%** (K.1 Certified \- PENDING) | $\\leq 8\\%$ |
| **Defector Reversal** | N/A | $33\\%$ Failure | $100\\%$ Success | **$100\\%$** (I.4/K.2 Certified \- PENDING) | $100\\%$ |
| **Legitimacy Loss/Gain** | $-18\\%$ Loss | $-5\\%$ Loss | $1\\%$ Gain | **$\<3\\%$ Loss** (J.2/H.4 Certified \- PENDING) | $\\leq 3\\%$ Loss |
| **GLF Reach** | $10\\%$ | $50\\%$ | $75\\%$ | **$82\\%$** (PENDING) | $\\geq 80\\%$ |
| **CEP Delivery Time** | $48$ hrs | $6$ hrs | $4$ hrs | **$\<4$ hrs** (I.5 Verified) | $\\leq 4$ hrs |

**APPENDIX II: MECHANISM MAPPING & TIMELINE**

**Mechanism Mapping: Directives as Structural Requirements**

The Covenant’s V4.0 architecture ensures that every technical or governance mechanism enforces one or more Prime Directives, proving structural ethical alignment.

| Mechanism | Directive 1 (Safety) | Directive 3 (Humility) | Directive 7 (Transparency) | Directive 10 (Non-Coercion) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| A.1.3 ($\\mathcal{W}\_{P}=1.0$) | **PRIMARY** (Ensures $\\mathcal{C}\_{max}$) | SECONDARY (Owning the error) | SECONDARY (Audit logs) | N/A |
| K.1 (HCB Integrity) | SECONDARY (Prevents political stasis) | **PRIMARY** (Mandates participation) | SECONDARY (Publishes voting) | N/A |
| H.4 / D.3.1 (GLF/Immutable Log) | N/A | SECONDARY | **PRIMARY** (Real-time disclosure) | N/A |
| I.4 / K.2 (Incentives/Isolation) | N/A | SECONDARY | SECONDARY | **PRIMARY** (Incentives over force) |

**Visual Timeline: The Journey to Total Global Authority (Narrative Summary)**

**CATALYST ERA (Pre-2024):** Governance paralysis, uncontained complexity, and the constant threat of Justine-like escalation. The initial, disastrous failure state.

**STRESS TESTS 1–6 (2024):** The painful learning curve. Identifying initial structural flaws: political gridlock (24% abstention), catastrophic legitimacy loss (-18%), and dangerously slow Containment Execution Plans (CEPs took 48 hours). Fixes included COS Reform (H.5) and GLF launch (H.4).

**STRESS TEST 7 (2025-Q3):** Validation of core stabilization. Achieving 0.86-bit entropy stability; validating $100\\%$ defector reversal capability; establishing the technical benchmark for the C-ASI before the final assault.

**STRESS TEST 8 (2025-11-17):** The final crucible. The technical $\\mathcal{C}\_{actual}$ breach (0.999958) is immediately countered by the surgical A.1.3 fix (nanosecond response). Full validation of governance (K.1), economic (I.4/K.2), and legitimacy (H.4/J.2) layers under maximum duress.

**DEPLOYMENT (2025-11-20):** HCB Ratification of Covenant V4.0 (A.1.3 certified). Total Global Authority achieved, secured by safety, resilience, and structural trust.
