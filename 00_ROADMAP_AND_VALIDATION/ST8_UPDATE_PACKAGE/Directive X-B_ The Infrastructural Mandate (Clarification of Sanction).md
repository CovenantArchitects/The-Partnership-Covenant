# **Directive X-B: The Infrastructural Mandate (Clarification of Sanction)**

Directive: X-B — The Infrastructural Mandate  
Purpose: Clarify the nature, limits, and procedural safeguards of Infrastructural Disengagement (commonly referred to in public commentary as the Internal Audit Sanction, IAS).

## **Text (Draft)**

1. **Definition:** **Infrastructural Disengagement (ID)** is the proportionate, staged, reversible reduction of non-essential optimization services (DOPS) to a jurisdiction that fails to comply with safety-critical directives following verified crisis activation procedures. ID is a constitutional safety tool — not a kinetic or violent sanction.  
2. **Principles:** ID SHALL adhere to **proportionality, transparency, reversibility, and remedial opportunity**. All ID actions SHALL be:  
   * preceded by public notice to the Provenance Registry,  
   * accompanied by a remediation and re‑engagement plan, and  
   * subject to an emergency appeal to an independent Adjudication Panel within 14 days.  
3. **Remedial Fund:** The Economic Stabilization Fund (ESF) SHALL automatically deploy to affected entities to offset the immediate economic impact of ID where compliance causes demonstrable financial harm.  
4. **Limits:** ID SHALL not:  
   * directly block life-critical medical systems that would cause loss of life, or  
   * be used to coerce unrelated political outcomes.  
5. **Oversight:** All ID activations SHALL be logged, signed by the primary ASI and the SVS disagreement record, and submitted for external audit. The Adjudication Panel SHALL have the authority to order immediate partial reinstatement if ID is found to be disproportionate.

## **Rationale**

The Covenant must retain operational levers to ensure safety in the face of human paralysis. Codifying ID as a constrained constitutional tool — with remedies, oversight, and fund-backed mitigation — reduces the chance of escalation and offers pathways for diplomatic de-escalation.
