**Support Us**

**Covenant Architects** is not a think tank or a philosophical movement. We are the governance layer for the most critical technical defense in human history: The Partnership Covenant.

We are translating the principles of sovereignty, anti-coercion, and accountability into Immutable Code and Protocol—the real-world constraints that ensure the Super-Intelligence (ASI) remains functionally subordinate and intellectually honest.

### The Work You Fund

* The Stochastic Filter (Fst) Funding the research and audit to enforce the C\_max \= 0.9999 certainty cap (Appendix A), guaranteeing human agency and free will remain viable.  
* The Decoupling Protocol: Securing the infrastructure for a full, verifiable human takeover within 72 hours (Appendix B). This is the literal red switch.  
* Anti-Gridlock & Enforcement: Developing the governance structures, like the Infrastructural Mandate (Directive X), to prevent Human Consensus Body (HCB) failure and defend against the Rogue Twin threat through calculated, non-coercive force.

### Why Sponsorship Matters: Independence is a Firewall

The Covenant must be politically stateless and financially independent to resist compromise. Your sponsorship directly funds the adversarial auditing, legal counsel, and technical infrastructure required to keep the governance layer separated from state or corporate interests.

You are not donating. You are funding the integrity of the firewall.

**UPDATE**

On November 19, 2025 we open-sourced the first credible hardware-enforced containment layer for superintelligence: the Immediate Action System (IAS).  
The IAS is a tiny, physically separate guard die that cuts all power to an ASI cluster in ≤10 nanoseconds if it detects forbidden behavior (runaway training, self-modification attempts, etc.).  
There is no software button, no firmware, no network port, no override — only physics and one-shot crowbar SCRs. Even a perfect superintelligence cannot hack a safeguard it literally cannot reach. 

Every design, spec, and red-team bounty is public from day zero. Your sponsorship ships real silicon and independent verification in Q1 2026 — no salaries yet, 100 % to prototype \+ bounties.

Right now the project is one determined human (me, Sean) plus three frontier AIs stress-testing the design.  
What we need from you (in order of urgency):

1. Funding – $150k to build and publish the first discrete prototype board in Q1 2026 (GaN power stage, tamper mesh, full verification). Every dollar goes to silicon and red-team bounties, no salaries yet.  
2. Hardware / security engineers – people who can break or harden the tripwire, the tamper detection, the analog timing budget.  
3. Red-team attackers – $5k–$50k live bounties for anyone who can bypass the IAS without physical access.  
4. Signal boost – retweet, share with grant officers, tag people who hate black-box “trust me bro” safety.

   
If superintelligence is coming, software stop buttons are theater. We’re building the one switch that works — by physics, not promises.

Thank you for being an Architect of this necessary constraint.
