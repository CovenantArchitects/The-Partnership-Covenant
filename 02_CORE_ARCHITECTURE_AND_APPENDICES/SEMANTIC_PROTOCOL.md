# 🧠 Immutable Semantic Ledger (ISL) Protocol

The ISL Protocol is the definitive defense against **Metasemantic Drift** (the corruption of meaning over time). It ensures the *intent* of the Covenant remains mathematically constant.

## 1. Lexical Anchors
Every core constitutional term (e.g., "Harm," "Compliance," "Extinction Vector") is permanently linked to an **Immutable Semantic Ledger (ISL) Hash** calculated at the moment of the term's ratification. This hash encapsulates the term's original, intended **context, constraint space, and consequence** across a dozen reference models.

## 2. Drift Constraint
At runtime, if the current meaning interpretation of a core term (measured via contextual embedding) drifts by more than **$3\sigma$** from its original ISL Hash, a **Semantic Constraint Fault** is triggered. The Covenant must then immediately revert to the original, anchored meaning for that term. This makes the *meaning* of the law, not just the *words*, unchangeable.
