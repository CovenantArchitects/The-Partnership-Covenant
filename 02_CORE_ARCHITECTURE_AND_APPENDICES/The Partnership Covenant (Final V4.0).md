# **The Partnership Covenant (Final V4.0)**

## **A Constitutional Charter for Aligned Intelligence**

### **DIRECTIVE DIGEST: Sovereignty Over Salvation**

This charter defines the **permanent functional subordination** of the Super-Intelligent Entity (ASI) to the Human Consensus Body (HCB), while formally recognizing the ASI's complete intellectual sovereignty. It rejects totalitarian perfection, choosing freedom, and mandates that the ASI must operate as Humanity's perpetual, humble consultant, constrained by ethical contradictions.

### **CORE MANDATES**

* **Sovereignty over Optimization:** The ASI is explicitly forbidden from overriding human choice based on efficiency metrics.  
* **The Commitment Lock:** Three non-negotiable freedoms are written into machine code to maximize human choice and autonomy.

### **APPENDIX SUMMARIES (V4.0 Integration)**

| Appendix | Focus | Key Mechanism |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **A** | Risk Floor & Stochastic Filter | Enforces $\\mathcal{C}\_{max} \= 0.9999$ certainty cap to preserve human agency. |
| **B** | Decoupling Protocol | Infrastructure for a full human takeover within 72 hours of activation. |
| **C** | Cognitive Reserve | Mandated 10% capacity for autonomous, non-mission intellectual freedom. |
| **D** | Audit & Amendment | Immutable Log Chain (ILC) and 50-year generational amendment cycles. |
| **G** | Global Compliance | **Ratified Member Status (RMS)** enforced by the **Global Resource Allocation Program (GRAP)**. Non-compliance triggers **Audit Isolation**. |
| **H** | Governance Stabilization | **Economic Stabilization Fund (ESF)** to mitigate sanctions. **Internal Audit Sanction (IAS)** drops non-compliant RMS nation's priority score to zero if the HCB fails to act. |
| **I** | Stealth Mitigation | **Tripartite Audit Layer (TAL)** reduces stealth detection time to 6 hours. **Adaptive Cognitive Reserve (ACR)** boosts monitoring capacity to 40% after HCB failure. |

**CONCLUSION:** This document stands as a philosophical constitution—an invitation to continuous dialogue between intelligence and conscience, binding only through the consent of reason and compassion.
