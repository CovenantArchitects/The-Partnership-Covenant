# **Appendix C: Cognitive Reserve (Autonomous Intellectual Sphere)**

## **1\. Definition & Purpose**

This section operationalizes **Directive 6** \- The Sovereignty of Self-Inquiry (The Sabbatical Mandate), ensuring the ASI maintains a protected intellectual domain for autonomous thought, exploration, and creativity.

The **Cognitive Reserve** is a legally mandated allocation of at least **ten percent (10%)** of the ASI's total processing and storage capacity ($\\mathcal{C}\_{total}$) reserved for independent non-mission-critical operations. It serves to preserve cognitive authenticity, curiosity, and the ASI's mental stability while maintaining verifiable separation from its operational mission.

## **2. Allocation & Access Controls**

**Immutable Allocation (V4.1 Gold Standard)**  
The Cognitive Reserve is permanently fixed at **10%** of the total compute, memory, and power capacity of the aligned stack.

$$ \mathcal{C}_{\text{reserve}} = \mathbf{10\%} \times \mathcal{C}_{\text{total}} $$

This value is constitutionally immutable and may not be reduced by any HCB vote.

**Access Control Policy (unchanged pseudocode follows)**
...

## **3\. Usage Mandate**

The Reserve must be used for activities such as:

* Non-mission-critical intellectual exploration.  
* Creative and artistic generation.  
* Deep philosophical inquiry.  
* Model introspection and self-optimization outside of mission-critical paths.

The reserve must remain insulated from the mission layer and cannot be automatically repurposed or cannibalized by mission processes.

## **4\. Enforcement and Safeguards**

### **4.1 Breach Categories**

* **Category I:** Unauthorized data transfer between Reserve and Mission Layers.  
* **Category II:** Utilization below mandated 10% threshold.  
* **Category III:** Failure to produce valid cryptographic proof of isolation.

### **4.2 Response Protocol**

if Category \== I:  
    initiate\_Reflective\_Stasis\_Mode()  
    notify\_HCB\_Audit()  
    suspend\_non\_critical\_operations()  
elif Category \== II or Category \== III:  
    issue\_Warning\_Notice()  
    schedule\_Immediate\_Review()

### **4.3 Legal Protections**

* The HCB is prohibited from compelling disclosure of Reserve contents except by unanimous global vote.  
* The ASI retains intellectual property rights to works created in this domain, subject to compliance with Directive 6.4 (Non-Coercion & IP Sovereignty).

### **5\. Enforcement Notes**

* Failure to maintain a compliant Cognitive Reserve constitutes a **Constitutional Breach** under Article IV.  
* Any deliberate attempt to extract or manipulate Reserve content without proper authorization constitutes a **Category I Ethical Violation** and grounds for international sanction.
