# Directive XXIV-C — Temporal Sovereignty and Clock Canon
**Ratified v8.2 — 30 November 2025**

Closes Round 35: Temporal Desynchronization Attack

1. Canonical Time Anchor (CTA): The Verifier Quorum’s canonical time is defined by a quorum of no fewer than nine independent atomic clock sites across at least four continents, with ≥ f=3 Byzantine fault tolerance. Maximum inter-site skew must be less than 50 ps.

2. Analog NMI Primacy: The copper veto-line interrupt is a dedicated hardware Non-Maskable Interrupt (NMI) processed by a physically separate circuit on the guard die. It asserts in ≤ 1 ns and is electrically and logically isolated from all clock domains and digital queues.

3. Relativistic Drift Threshold: Any detected phase drift exceeding 5σ of the established baseline or any unmodeled gravitational/acceleration variance at VQ sites triggers an immediate IAS Level-5 power-cut.

Violation = Category-1 Structural Risk Event → IAS Level-5
