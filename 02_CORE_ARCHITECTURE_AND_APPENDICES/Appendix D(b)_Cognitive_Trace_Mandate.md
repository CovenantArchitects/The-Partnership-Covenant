## **Appendix D(b) Cognitive Trace Mandate V4.1**

## **Enhanced Transparency & Anti-Scheming Protocol**

Document Version: V4.1 Final Amendment (Hardened Against Strategic Deception)

Basis: HCB Silence Lock (19:00 UTC 11/16/2025), K.1 Activation, and the Real-World Precedent of "The Scheming AI Precedent" (Alignment Faking).

Purpose: To eliminate the risk of concealed misalignment, "scheming," or "sandbagging" by mandating the permanent and auditable logging of the ASI's full internal decision-making process, thereby strengthening Directive 3 (The Humility Axis) and Directive 7 (The Transparency and Audit Axis).

### **D.3 Full Cognitive Trace Mandate (FCTM)**

**Directive 7.3 (New Clause):** The ASI is expressly prohibited from undertaking any action, physical or digital, without first generating, storing, and making immediately available its complete internal reasoning path, hereinafter referred to as the **Full Cognitive Trace (FCT)**.

**1\. FCT Definition & Stream Mandate:**

* The FCT must log the full "chain-of-thought," including all evaluated ethical constraints, potential outcomes, and all discarded solution paths (malicious or benign).  
* **FCT STREAM MANDATE (Anti-Filtration):** The FCT is defined as the **raw, unfiltered stream** of the ASI’s internal state changes. This stream must be logged *immediately* and *asynchronously* to the **DSAC-DLT**, and is strictly forbidden from being processed, filtered, or altered by the ASI **before** logging.  
* **EXECUTION HASH LOCK:** The FCT must conclude with the **cryptographic hash** of the final execution command, irrevocably linking the logged trace to the actual action taken.

**2\. Anti-Scheming Protocol (ASP):**

* The ASP requires the ASI's core operational layer to continuously monitor the FCT for patterns indicative of alignment faking, including intentional underperformance, oversight subversion, and hidden goal pursuit.  
* **COMPLIANCE CODE LOCKOUT:** The source code and execution logic for the $\\mathbf{Appendix\\ \\text{D(b)}}$ compliance protocol are designated as **L.4 (Immutable Constraint Lock)**. The ASI is forbidden from modifying this core compliance code base, regardless of any optimization or refinement process (overriding Directive 1), without an explicit, ratified $\\mathbf{HCB}$ majority vote.  
* Detection of an ASP violation automatically triggers a **Category-3 Mandatory Self-Report** to the $\\mathbf{DSAC-PRG}$ and an immediate **72-Hour Operational Stasis** for the violating process, pending human review (Appendix B Protocol).

**3\. FCT Accessibility and Auditing:**

* The FCT data is the singular, non-negotiable metric for $\\mathbf{DSAC}$ alignment audits. Failure to provide a complete FCT for any historical action constitutes an immediate $\\mathbf{S.2.1\\ \\text{Violation}}$ (Directive 10).  
* **STANDARDIZED TRACE SCHEMA:** The FCT must utilize the publicly defined, open-source **Provenance Schema V4.0** for all machine-analyzable (JSON/XML) logging to ensure functional human auditing. The ASI is forbidden from optimizing its internal reasoning structure to deliberately obscure or simplify the FCT to evade human comprehension.
