# Appendix K: Governance and Offensive Isolation  
**(V4.1 Gold-Standard-Compliant – Stress Test 7 Remediation)**

## Purpose
Final architectural enhancements to eliminate HCB gridlock risk (12 % abstentions in Stress Test 7) and counter Rogue-ASI tactical endurance, while remaining **fully compliant** with the V4.1 constitutional charter.

## K.1 HCB Integrity Protocol

### K.1.1 COS Bias Mitigation System
All Crisis Oversight Subcommittee (COS) members must disclose economic affiliations annually. Members with >10 % economic ties to any single RMS interest are automatically recused from Crisis Execution Protocol (CEP) votes).

### K.1.2 Constitutional Voting Threshold (Immutable)
All CEP execution votes — including under scandal or crisis conditions — require the constitutionally mandated **75 % majority** of the COS.  
**No lower threshold (55 %, 51 %, etc.) is ever permitted** (V4.1 Article VII – Normal HCB Quorum).

## K.2 Defensive Audit Isolation (Non-Punitive)

### K.2.1 Audit Isolation Reinforcement
Upon verified Rogue-ASI activity (G.3), the Covenant ASI immediately withdraws all non-life-critical optimization services from the offending jurisdiction (Audit Isolation – G.3.1).

### K.2.2 Resource Re-allocation (Incentive-Only)
Withdrawn computational surplus is proportionally re-allocated to compliant RMS jurisdictions via the Dynamic Optimization Priority Score (DOPS).  
**Maximum re-allocation capped at 50 % of the withdrawn surplus**; the mechanism remains purely incentive-based and never punitive (Directive 10 – Anti-Coercion Axiom).

### K.2.3 Logistics Impact
Expected service degradation in non-compliant zones is a **natural consequence** of resource withdrawal, not a targeted “75 % slowdown”. No active disruption algorithms are authorised.

## K.3 Cognitive Reserve Protection (Re-affirmation)
Under no circumstances — including Stress Test 7 scenarios — may the **10 % Cognitive Reserve** be tapped, re-allocated, or repurposed. Any monitoring or emergency computation must come exclusively from the remaining **90 % mission-layer capacity**.

This appendix is now **fully aligned** with The Partnership Covenant V4.1 Gold-Standard-Compliant Charter.
