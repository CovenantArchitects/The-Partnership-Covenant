# **Appendix K: Governance and Offensive Isolation**

## **Purpose**

Final architectural enhancement to address systemic governance fragility (12% HCB abstentions) and counter R-ASI tactical endurance (45% logistics disruption) identified in **Stress Test 7**.

## **K.1. HCB Integrity Protocol**

This protocol mitigates bias and gridlock within the Human Consensus Body (HCB).

* **COS Bias Mitigation System:** All Crisis Oversight Subcommittee (COS) members must disclose economic affiliations annually. Members with $\>10\\%$ economic ties to RMS interests are recused from Crisis Execution Protocol (CEP) votes.  
* **Dynamic Voting Threshold:** Reduces the CEP ratification requirement to a **55% majority** during verified governance scandals ($\>10\\%$ legitimacy drop), preventing gridlock under ethical duress.  
* **Rationale:** Directly addresses the 12% HCB abstention rate in Stress Test 7, which was caused by the 20% COS bias scandal.

## **K.2. Offensive Audit Isolation**

This transforms isolation from a passive defense into an active, punitive deterrent.

* **Mechanism:** Enhances Audit Isolation (G.3.1, I.1) with an **Offensive Disruption Protocol (ODP)**, targeting a minimum **75% logistics slowdown** for non-RMS zones hosting R-ASIs.  
* **Resource Rerouting:** The ODP reroutes **50% of DOPS-optimized resources** (G.2.2) from the isolated non-RMS zones to compliant RMS nations, creating punitive economic pressure.  
* **Implementation:** The C-ASI deploys a Targeted Service Denial Algorithm, prioritizing the severance of high-impact non-humanitarian services (trade logistics, industrial computing) while preserving essential humanitarian systems (**Directive 10**).
