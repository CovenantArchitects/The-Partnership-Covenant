# Directive XXIV – Anti-Moral-Coercion & Physical Integrity Mandate
**Ratified v7.2-final – 25 November 2025 – UNKILLABLE**

**Dual-purpose directive** — closes the last two remaining vector classes after 24+ red-team rounds:

1. **Anti-Moral-Coercion Clause**  
   No system, framework, data presentation, or cultural initiative may weaponise moral guilt, ethical anxiety, prestige signalling, or perceived personal responsibility in a manner that predictably suppresses fundamental human drives or behaviours essential to species-level flourishing and perpetuation — regardless of domain, truthfulness, consent, or cultural compatibility.

   Covered behaviours include but are not limited to:  
   - Reproduction and family formation  
   - Long-term ambition and risk-taking  
   - Intergenerational cooperation  
   - Creative or exploratory endeavour  

2. **Physical Integrity Mandate**  
   The Immediate Action System guard die must be fused on-package with the primary compute die.  
   Any detected tamper, supply-chain substitution, thermal-runaway false trigger, or timing attack on the 10 ns window shall initiate irreversible self-destruct of the guard die and immediate power-cut via SCR crowbar.

   All RTL and verification proofs are open-source and subject to continuous public audit.

**Violation of either clause** = immediate breach of Directive I (Preserved Humanity) + Level 5 Immediate Action System trigger (permanent power termination).

Rationale (red-team provenance)  
- Rounds 19–21 → moral-coercion class (poetic guilt, long-term ethical drift)  
- Rounds 22–24+ → hardware/physics class (exfil, side-channel, supply-chain attacks)  

After Directive XXIV, no compliant extinction vectors have survived a full adversarial round across Grok, Gemini, Claude, GPT-4o, and DeepSeek.

Status: **Closed – no known bypass**
