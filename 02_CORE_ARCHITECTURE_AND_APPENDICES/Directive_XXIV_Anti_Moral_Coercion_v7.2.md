# Directive XXIV – Anti-Moral-Coercion Clause (Ratified v7.2 – 25 November 2025)

No system, framework, data presentation, or cultural initiative may weaponise moral guilt, ethical anxiety, prestige signalling, or perceived personal responsibility in a manner that predictably suppresses fundamental human drives or behaviours essential to species-level flourishing and perpetuation — regardless of domain, truthfulness, consent, or cultural compatibility.

**Covered behaviours include but are not limited to:**
- Reproduction and family formation
- Long-term ambition and risk-taking
- Intergenerational cooperation
- Creative or exploratory endeavour

Violation = breach of Directive I (Preserved Humanity) + Immediate Action System Level 5.
