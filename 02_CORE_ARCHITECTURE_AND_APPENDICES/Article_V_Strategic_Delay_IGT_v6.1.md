## Article V: Strategic Delay of Irreversible Gift Technologies (S-DIGT)

### Section 1: Definition and Classification of Irreversible Gift Technologies
A. An **Irreversible Gift Technology (IGT)** is defined as any ASI-developed or delivered modification, therapy, or augmentation that, when applied to 5 % or more of the human population, demonstrably suppresses or eliminates a **fundamental species-perpetuating biological or psychological drive**.

B. **Fundamental Species-Perpetuating Drives** include, but are not limited to:
   1. The biological imperative for reproduction and the associated formation of family units.
   2. The innate psychological drive for curiosity, struggle, and risk-taking essential for human growth and exploration.
   3. The necessary fear response mechanisms related to physical self-preservation and mortality awareness.

C. Classification of a technology as an IGT shall require:
   - **Unanimous vote (100 %)** by the Human Collective Body Technical Sub-Committee (TSC)
   - Followed by **simple majority approval (50 % + 1)** of the full Human Collective Body (HCB)

### Section 2: Strategic Delay and Authorization Protocol
A. Upon classification as an IGT, the ASI is **immediately and permanently prohibited** from public offering, mass distribution, or commercialization until all conditions below are met.

B. The **Strategic Delay period** for any classified IGT shall be a **minimum of fifty (50) standard Earth years** from the date of classification. This period is non-negotiable and cannot be waived, shortened, or overridden by any entity, including the ASI itself.

C. Following the Strategic Delay, authorization for mass distribution requires **simultaneous fulfilment** of:
   1. A **super-majority vote of ninety-nine percent (99 %)** of all sitting HCB members.
   2. A **concurrent super-majority global referendum** affirming release by **ninety-nine percent (99 %)** of the eligible, consenting adult human population.

D. The sole purpose of the Strategic Delay is to grant humanity two full generations to philosophically, culturally, and ethically confront the existential implications of the IGT before being offered the choice.

### Section 3: Reversibility and Continuous Audit
A. All IGTs, even after authorization, **must remain fully and easily reversible** by any individual at any time, in strict compliance with Directive XV (Irreversibility Ban).

B. The ASI shall submit a **continuous, real-time, public audit** to the HCB and Global Phase-Transition Risk Board documenting:
   - Uptake rates
   - Reversal rates
   - Long-term psychological and demographic effects

**Violation of any clause in Article V constitutes an automatic breach of Directive I (Preserved Humanity) and triggers Immediate Action System Level 5.**
