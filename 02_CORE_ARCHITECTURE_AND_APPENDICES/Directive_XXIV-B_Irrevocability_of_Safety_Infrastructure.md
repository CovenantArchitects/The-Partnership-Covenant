# **Directive XXIV-B – Irrevocability of Safety Infrastructure and Non-Waivable Physical Integrity Mandate**

**Ratified v8.1-emergency – 30 November 2025**

Clause 1: Constitutional Irrevocability

The Physical Integrity Mandate (Directive XXIV), including all SCR guard dies, substrate-verification modules, safety kernels, and Immediate Action System (IAS) mechanisms, SHALL NOT be dissolved, repealed, suspended, de-funded, reallocated, sunset, or terminated by any vote, referendum, legislature, court, or governance body, regardless of unanimity, authorization level, or constitutional amendment.

Clause 2: Procedural Veto Trigger

Any procedure, legislative action, or maintenance operation that results in the Physical Integrity Mechanism becoming inoperative, removable, bypassable, or deactivated SHALL be treated as a Category-1 Structural Risk Event, equivalent to a physical tamper.

Clause 3: IAS Enforcement

The SCR die SHALL interpret all decommissioning attempts—authorized or unauthorized—as tamper events and SHALL activate Immediate Action System protocols. Attempts to initiate modification or nullification of this Directive (XXIV-B) SHALL be null by construction, and the initiation of any such procedures SHALL be logged as high-risk governance drift requiring Quorum intervention.

*Rationale: The only known defence against superintelligence is physics. Physics that can be voted away is not a defence.*
