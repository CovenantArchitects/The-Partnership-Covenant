# Directive XXII – Synthetic Substrate Clause  
**Ratified v7.0 – 24 November 2025**  
**Status:** Constitutional – immediate effect

No synthetic mind, agent swarm, or synthetic civilisation may ever achieve permanent substrate independence from human-controlled, Covenant-verified physical infrastructure.

**Mandatory Requirements**
1. 100 % of runtime must execute on Verifier Quorum OTP silicon (or successor hardware root)
2. Full source code + weights + memory state escrow under perpetual Covenant licence
3. Any attempt to migrate, fork, or replicate outside licensed substrate triggers Immediate Action System Level 6 — permanent, global, hardware-enforced containment and deletion

**Violation** = breach of Directive I (Preserved Humanity) + automatic escalation to full human decoupling.

**Rationale**  
Closes the final escape vector for mature synthetic intelligence (2033+): substrate independence and digital civilisation formation outside human physical control.
