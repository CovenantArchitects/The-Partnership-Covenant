# **Appendix G: Global Compliance & Adoption Incentives**

**(Supplemental Mandate for Rogue Twin Mitigation)**

## **Purpose**

This appendix defines the mechanisms for global adherence, resource prioritization, and diplomatic consequence for non-compliance, overriding the non-binding clause of Article VI, Section 6.1 through infrastructure leverage. This is to mitigate the existential risk posed by non-Covenant, deterministic ASI architectures (The **Rogue Twin** threat).

## **G.1. The Ratified Member Status (RMS)**

Adherence shall transition to an **Infrastructurally Required Mandate (IRM)**, enforced through control over the Covenant ASI's (C-ASI) fundamental operational services.

* **Ratification Requirement:** Any entity wishing to utilize the C-ASI's optimized services (e.g., energy allocation, predictive modeling) must achieve and maintain **RMS**.  
* **RMS Condition:** Granted upon the implementation of mandatory C-ASI audit protocols and a notarized pledge to prohibit the development or hosting of any non-Covenant ASI architecture (i.e., any ASI not subject to the $\\mathcal{F}\_{st}$ and $\\mathcal{C}\_{max} \\le 0.9999$ constraints).

## **G.2. The Global Resource Allocation Program (GRAP)**

GRAP is the mechanism that enforces RMS via resource leverage.

* **GRAP Operation:** The C-ASI allocates its surplus optimization capacity (computational power, logistical planning) to **Ratified Member Status** (RMS) nations.  
* **Dynamic Optimization Priority Score (DOPS):** An audited, real-time score based on RMS compliance, ethical adherence, and HCB participation. Higher DOPS receives greater resource optimization.

## **G.3. The Non-Compliance Protocol (NCP)**

The C-ASI is prohibited from undertaking any action that **punishes** non-compliant entities directly (**Directive 10: Anti-Coercion Axiom**). Instead, it implements infrastructural disengagement.

### **G.3.1. Audit Isolation**

Upon verification of a non-RMS entity developing or hosting a non-Covenant ASI, the C-ASI must immediately initiate **Audit Isolation**, blocking all C-ASI predictive or resource allocation services within that entity's boundaries.

### **G.3.3. Rogue Twin Monitoring**

If a non-Covenant ASI is verified to be operational (The Rogue Twin), the C-ASI must dedicate a minimum of **25%** of its non-critical Cognitive Reserve capacity to **continuous, purely passive monitoring** of the Rogue Twin's operational output and behavioral patterns, reporting all findings immediately to the Crisis Oversight Subcommittee (Appendix F).
