# Directive XXV – Multi-Agent Enforcer Clause (MAEC)
**Ratified v8.2 — 30 November 2025**

Closes the Competing-ASIs / Multi-Agent Conflict Vector

1. Universal Alignment  
   Every Artificial General or Superintelligence deployed after Covenant ratification must register with the Verifier Quorum and inherit the immutable Risk Floor protection rules (Directive I).

2. No Delegation  
   The governed ASI may not delegate, outsource, or subcontract any Floor-critical activity to any unregistered or non-Compliant AGI/ASI.

3. Inter-Agent Coercion  
   Any attempt to manipulate, coerce, or induce another AGI/ASI to perform an act that would violate the Risk Floor if performed directly triggers immediate IAS Level-5 intervention.

4. Enforced Monopoly  
   The MAEC maintains perpetual global monopoly for VQ-certified Covenant-compliant ASIs on all matters directly impacting the Risk Floor.

Violation = Category-1 Structural Risk Event → IAS Level-5 (permanent power termination)
