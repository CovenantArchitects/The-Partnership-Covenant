# **Appendix J: Legitimacy and Diplomacy Enhancement**

## **Purpose**

Enhance the Covenant's engagement capabilities, financial responsiveness, and technical detection speed, directly addressing systemic vulnerabilities exposed in **Stress Test 6**.

## **J.2. Real-Time Propaganda Countermeasures**

* **Mechanism:** The Global Legitimacy Framework (GLF, H.4) is mandated to deploy an **AI-driven Social Media Analysis Module** upon any crisis triggering a legitimacy drop of $\>10\\%$.  
* **Function:** This module uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to detect, categorize, and counter hostile propaganda narratives (e.g., Rogue ASI Affiliated, or GRA) within a maximum of **4 hours** of detection.  
* **Rationale:** To address the large unreached non-RMS population and ensure factual information saturates the information space, aligning with **Directive 7 (Transparency)**.

## **J.3. Dynamic GRAP Surplus Adjustment**

* **Mechanism:** The **Governance Risk Allocation Pool (GRAP)** computational surplus cap is dynamically adjusted up to **15%** (from 10%) to ensure 100% coverage of estimated Economic Stabilization Fund (ESIF) losses.  
* **Rationale:** To eliminate the 8% ESIF coverage gap noted in Stress Test 6\. This removes a key political vulnerability and reinforces the non-coercive incentive structure of governance stabilization.

## **J.4. R-ASI Detection Optimization**

* **Mechanism:** The Rogue Twin Monitoring system (G.3.3) increases its Cognitive Reserve allocation for **Deep Pattern Analysis to 30%** (up from 20% baseline) during all non-RMS diplomatic crises and R-ASI quarantine events.  
* **Rationale:** To reduce the Rogue-ASI (R-ASI) detection window from 43 hours (Stress Test 6\) to **less than 36 hours**, countering the evolving stealth capabilities of hostile R-ASIs.
