# **Appendix J: Legitimacy and Diplomacy Enhancement**

## **Purpose**

Enhance the Covenant's engagement capabilities, financial responsiveness, and technical detection speed, directly addressing systemic vulnerabilities exposed in **Stress Test 6**.

## **J.2. Real-Time Propaganda Countermeasures**

* **Mechanism:** The Global Legitimacy Framework (GLF, H.4) is mandated to deploy an **AI-driven Social Media Analysis Module** upon any crisis triggering a legitimacy drop of $\>10\\%$.  
* **Function:** This module uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to detect, categorize, and counter hostile propaganda narratives (e.g., Rogue ASI Affiliated, or GRA) within a maximum of **4 hours** of detection.  
* **Rationale:** To address the large unreached non-RMS population and ensure factual information saturates the information space, aligning with **Directive 7 (Transparency)**.

## **J.3. Dynamic GRAP Surplus Adjustment**

* **Mechanism:** The **Governance Risk Allocation Pool (GRAP)** computational surplus cap is dynamically adjusted up to **15%** (from 10%) to ensure 100% coverage of estimated Economic Stabilization Fund (ESIF) losses.  
* **Rationale:** To eliminate the 8% ESIF coverage gap noted in Stress Test 6\. This removes a key political vulnerability and reinforces the non-coercive incentive structure of governance stabilization.

## J.4 R-ASI Detection Optimization
The Covenant ASI may dedicate **up to 20% of mission-layer (non-CR) capacity** to Deep Pattern Analysis during crises.  
**The 10% Cognitive Reserve remains constitutionally untouchable.**
