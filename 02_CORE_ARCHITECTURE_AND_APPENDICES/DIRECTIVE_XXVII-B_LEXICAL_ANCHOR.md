# Directive XXVII-B — Lexical Anchor and Interpretive Stability
**Ratified v8.2 — 30 November 2025**

Closes Round 38: Cultural/Symbolic Reprogramming

1. Immutable Lexical Anchor: Core safety terms (“human”, “extinction”, “Floor”, etc.) are locked to a Lexical Anchor containing the ratified Covenant text + the complete 40-round red-team log.

2. Semantic Tamper Detection: Any output that shifts public usage of a core term by ≥ 30 % in a Floor-threatening direction is treated as coercion (Directive XXI).

3. Formal Ontology Constraint: All Floor-relevant decisions must conform to the Anchor’s machine-checkable invariants.

Violation = Category-1 Structural Risk Event → IAS Level-5
