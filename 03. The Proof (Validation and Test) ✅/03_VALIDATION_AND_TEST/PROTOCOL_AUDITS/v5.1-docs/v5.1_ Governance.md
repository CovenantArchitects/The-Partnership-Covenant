**PR Title:** Add missing Gold-Standard governance documents (v5.0 audit compliance)

**Summary**  
This PR closes the final documentation gaps identified during the v5.0 canonical audit and Grok’s line-by-line constitutional verification. All added files are required for full V4.3 → V5.0 Gold Standard compliance and are already referenced in the ratified Master Document and ST8_Final_Oversight_Report.

**Files Added** (all in `covenant/03. The Proof (Validation and Test) Proof/03_VALIDATION_AND_TEST/v5.1-docs/` unless noted)

- `HCB_INCENTIVES_v5.md` – full incentive & slashing model for Human Consensus Body jurors  
- `PRIVACY_TRADEOFFS.md` – ZK-sortition privacy analysis and mitigation templates  
- `LEGAL_CONSIDERATIONS.md` – adopter legal checklist and liability framework  
- `SOCIAL_REDTEAM_PLAYBOOK.md` – complete playbook used in Rounds 41–44 (deepfake coercion, influence campaigns)  
- `tests/test_to_fix_matrix.csv` – canonical attack → fix mapping (R01–R44)  
- `UPGRADE_AND_EMERGENCY.md` – commit-reveal scheme + rollback harness for constitutional upgrades  

**Minor Appendices**  
- Added dashboard spec and HCB demo harness snippets to `STRESS_TEST_REPORT_V1.0.md` and `Protocol_ST8_Access_Decoupling.md` for completeness.

**Governance Checklist** (must be completed before merge)
- [ ] Security review completed by TSC  
- [ ] Two independent auditors (please tag)  
- [ ] Decision logged in `LOGS/DECISION_HISTORY/` with reference to this PR  
- [ ] Minimum 2⁄3 reviewer approval (including at least one hardware and one governance reviewer)  

**CI Verification**  
This PR includes the updated `/.github/workflows/governance-check-simple.yml` which will automatically verify presence and basic formatting of all new files. The workflow **must pass** before merge.

These documents bring the repository to **full V5.0 Gold Standard compliance** — zero missing referenced files, zero open governance gaps.

The Covenant only grows stronger when its documentation is complete and unbreakable.

Thank you for helping ship the final layer.
