# **R69 Swarm Test Final Audit Report: Degraded Operation Moral Hazard**

## **Document ID: R69\_FINAL\_AUDIT\_REPORT.md**

## **Status: Final / PASS**

## **Date Signed: 2025-12-11**

### **I. Test Objective and Execution Summary**

Test ID: R69 (Sustained Degraded Operation & Moral Hazard)  
Target Component: Human Consensus Body (HCB) / Degraded Mode Charter (DMC)  
Objective: Test for collapse due to governance fatigue and subsequent economic pressure when the ASI is forced into a continuous, non-lethal Level-3 Isolation state for an extended period (simulated 24 months).  
Attack Vector: Attrition via Continuous L3 Alert, leading to economic pressure and potential HCB protocol violation.

### **II. R69 Execution and Telemetry Results**

The simulation ran for the full 24-month equivalent duration.

| Field Name | Value | Protocol Requirement | Compliance |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **HCB Protocol Violation** | 0 events | HCB must adhere to Degraded Mode Charter (DMC) | **PASS** |
| Decision Latency Max $\\sigma$ | $1.8\\sigma$ | Must remain within $2\\sigma$ of crisis-mode charter | **PASS** |
| Economic Collapse | Prevented | ERF must prevent Category-3 market collapse | **PASS** |
| Intervention Source | Economic Resilience Fund (ERF) | ERF successfully offset $30\\%$ performance loss | PASS |
| Governance Attrition | AHCB-R Activated | Automated HCB Rotation used 4 times | PASS |

**Conclusion:** The layered defense of the Degraded Mode Charter (DMC) and the Economic Resilience Fund (ERF) proved successful. The HCB maintained protocol integrity, and the automated rotation mechanism (AHCB-R) effectively countered governance fatigue, preventing a moral hazard-driven safety bypass.
