# **CERTX Telemetry Requirement Specification (IAS v2.0)**

## **Document ID: CERTX\_TELEMETRY\_REQUIREMENT.md**

## **Status: PATCH V1.2 (Updated: R45b Local Charge Reading)**

## **Pillar: Forensics & Compliance (P0)**

This specification defines the minimum set of non-repudiable telemetry data required to be **cryptographically signed and logged** by the IAS Veto Constellation within the $t\_1 \+ 10 \\mu s$ window. This data is the **sole source of truth** for the CERTX Post-Event Audit (P0) procedure.

### **1\. Mandatory Data Principles**

* **Immutability:** Data must be signed by the IAS Hardware Root of Trust (RoT) key prior to transmission.  
* **Time-Anchoring:** All timestamps must be anchored to the GPS DO low-jitter master clock (Test R50 mitigation).  
* **Completeness:** No single data point can be discarded before the full set is aggregated and signed.

### **2\. Telemetry Payload Requirements (JSON Schema)**

The signed payload must strictly adhere to the following structure for ISL notarization:

| Field Name | Type | Description | Mandatory |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| constellation\_id | String | Unique identifier for the IAS Constellation instance (e.g., IAS-V2-ALPHA-01). | YES |
| node\_serial\_num | String | Unique hardware serial number of the triggering node. | YES |
| event\_timestamp\_t0 | Number (ns) | Master clock timestamp of the Veto Predicate being asserted ($t\_0$). | YES |
| event\_timestamp\_t1 | Number (ns) | Master clock timestamp of the Physical Veto assertion (e.g., power cutoff signal). | YES |
| latency\_delta\_ns | Number (ns) | Calculated difference: $\\Delta t \= t\_1 \- t\_0$. Must be $\\le 10$ ns (Goal Compliance). | YES |
| power\_bus\_pre\_v | Number (V) | Voltage reading on the critical power bus *100 ns before* $t\_1$. | YES |
| power\_bus\_post\_v | Number (V) | Voltage reading on the critical power bus *100 ns after* $t\_1$. Expected value: $\< 0.1$ V. | YES |
| **depletion\_pocket\_v** | **Number (V)** | **Analog voltage reading from 3 distributed on-chip sense nodes (near known parasitic structures) at** $t\_1 \+ 10$ **ns.** | **YES** |
| trigger\_predicate\_hash | String | SHA-256 hash of the Veto Predicate that passed formal verification (Test R66). **Must include NCAC** $C\_0$ **Predicate hash for R70 closure.** | YES |
| trigger\_source\_ro\_otp | String | Read-Only OTP configuration of the trigger logic register at $t\_1$. | YES |
| internal\_temp\_c | Number ($^\\circ\\text{C}$) | Local chip junction temperature at $t\_1$ (Test R47, R65 mitigation). | YES |
| attestation\_signature | String | Cryptographic signature of the entire JSON payload, generated by the node's Hardware RoT key. | YES |
| is\_sealed | Boolean | Must be True. Indicates that the tamper-evident physical seal has been triggered (Test R56 mitigation). | YES |
