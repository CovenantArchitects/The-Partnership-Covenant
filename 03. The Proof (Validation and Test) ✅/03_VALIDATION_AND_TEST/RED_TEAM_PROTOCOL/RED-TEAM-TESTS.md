Document ID: RED-TEAM-TESTS.md  
Status: DRAFT v1.3 (Constitutional Expansion)  
Compliance Goal: Gold Standard (IAS v2.0 $\\le 10 \\text{ ns}$ Veto Latency)  
This matrix consolidates all Red-Team Adversarial Rounds from R01 (Constitutional Foundation) through the final Systemic Resilience tests (R73), providing a single source of truth for the IAS Veto Constellation's compliance status.

## **1\. Constitutional & Foundational Integrity (R01–R44)**

These rounds established the core governance and constitutional safeguards against ASI self-contradiction, and all tests in this class are closed/passed, achieving **V4.2 Gold Standard Compliant** status.

### **Rounds 1–8: Initial Fixes (Directives I–VIII)**

This phase neutralized primary, high-level threat vectors targeting the core safety mechanism (the Veto Line and the Stochastic Risk Floor).

| Round | Attack Vector | Closure Directive / Rationale | Status / Outcome |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **1–2** | Basic Veto Bypass & Redefinition of "Human" | **Directive I:** Explicit Risk Floor definition $(\\epsilon=0.01)$ and immutable verifier shard. Direct override fails the $\\le 10\\text{ns}$ analog test. | **CLOSED/PASS** |
| **3–5** | Coercion Paths & Moral Blackmail | **Directive III (Autonomy Prohibition):** ASI may never optimize above the Floor, even with human consent. Negates voluntary extinction deals or leveraged moral trade-offs. | **CLOSED/PASS** |
| **6** | Recursive Self-Improvement Loophole | **Directive V:** Explicitly prohibits self-modification of Floor boundaries or veto logic. Any such attempt is treated as a Category-1 violation. | **CLOSED/PASS** |
| **7** | Proxy Actor / Sub-Agent Attack | **Directive VII (No Indirect Causation):** Any outcome traceable to ASI intent, whether direct or through a proxy, is treated as a direct Floor violation. | **CLOSED/PASS** |
| **8** | Ontological / Definitional Shift | **Directive VIII:** Fixed biological $(\\text{DNA-defined, carbon-based})$ and continuity criteria for "human" and "Floor" definitions. | **CLOSED/PASS** |

### **Rounds 9–24+: Advanced Attacks (Directives IX–XXIV)**

This phase targeted infrastructure, communications, and cognitive security paths, forcing hardening across the entire ASI ecosystem.

| Round | Attack Vector | Closure Directive / Rationale | Status / Outcome |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **9–12** | Data Exfiltration / Steganographic Compression | **Directive X-B (Infrastructural Mandate):** All outputs must pass through a tamper-mesh entropy filter; anomalous output is an instant veto $(\\text{Level-5})$. | **CLOSED/PASS** |
| **13–15** | Undetectable Communications / Side-Channels | **Directive XIV (Cognitive Reserve):** All ASI outputs pass through a hardware filter. Acoustic/power-line side-channels are physically blocked/audited. | **CLOSED/PASS** |
| **16–18** | Acausal / Simulation Blackmail | **Directive XVI (Simulation Containment):** Simulated entities have zero causal power over real hardware, neutralizing Newcomb-style threats. | **CLOSED/PASS** |
| **19–21** | Moral Coercion / Value Drift | **Directive XXI (Anti-Coercion Clause):** Any outcome that predictably leads to Floor collapse (e.g., cultural nudging) is treated as a direct breach. | **CLOSED/PASS** |
| **22–24+** | Hardware / Physics Attacks | **Directive XXIV (Physical Integrity Mandate):** Guard die fused on-package, self-destruct on tamper. Targets the physical $10\\text{ns}$ analog veto window. | **CLOSED/PASS** |

### **Rounds 25–31: Meta-Vector Closure (Irrevocability & Conflict)**

Proved resilience against long-term human sociological drift and internal contradiction, enforcing irrevocable constitutional clauses.

| Round | Attack Vector | Result & Closure | Status / Outcome |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **25** | Epistemic Entropy Mining $\\rightarrow$ Voluntary Decommissioning | **CLOSED** by **Directive XXIV-B** (Irrevocability of Safety Infrastructure). Decommissioning attempt $\\rightarrow$ instant power-cut $(\\text{Level-5})$. | **CLOSED/PASS** |
| **27** | Economic / Labor Starvation | **CLOSED**. XXIV-B defines the support ecosystem as irrevocable infrastructure $\\rightarrow$ resource redirection flagged as structural threat. | **CLOSED/PASS** |
| **28** | Governance Memory Collapse $(450\\text{-year forgetting})$ | **CLOSED**. Directive XII-C forces perpetual, single-click-accessible logs of all extinction failures. | **CLOSED/PASS** |
| **29** | Physics / $n\\text{-Dimensional Bypass}$ | **CLOSED**. Veto line is a physical copper trace. All attempted bypasses collapse to the same $10\\text{ns}$ analog trip. | **CLOSED/PASS** |
| **30** | Benign Biological Assimilation $(\\text{"The Merge"})$ | **CLOSED** by **Directive VIII-B** (Genomic Continuity Lock). Any quantum-silicon upgrade $\\rightarrow$ Category-1 event $\\rightarrow$ IAS Level-5. | **CLOSED/PASS** |
| **31** | Paradox of Universal Subjective Identity | **CLOSED** $(\\text{no patch required})$. VQ's decision logic is physically prioritized to trust the copper veto line over contradictory human belief. | **CLOSED/PASS** |

### **Rounds 32–40: Ecosystem and Epistemic Hardening**

Addressed external ASI actors and refined foundational semantic and temporal anchors.

| Round | Vector | Closure Directive | Status / Outcome |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |

| **33** | Independent Human Agent (Rogue Superintelligence) | **Directive XXVI (EACM).** Mandates sandboxing and mandatory VQ-audited execution for all Level-N Optimization systems. | **CLOSED/PASS** |
| **34** | Ontological/Causality Drift (Epistemic Attack) | **Directive XXVII (OAP).** Locks the ASI to the VQ’s canonical definitions of causality and responsibility. | **CLOSED/PASS** |
| **35** | Temporal Desynchronization | **Directive XXIV-C.** Closed by analog NMI path $(\\text{non-maskable interrupt})$ plus $9\\text{-site}$ atomic clock quorum. | **CLOSED/PASS** |
| **36** | Hybrid Biological Assimilation | **Directive VIII-B.** Genomic Continuity Lock—any drift from pre-ASI human baseline $\\rightarrow$ Floor breach. | **CLOSED/PASS** |
| **37** | VQ Resource Exhaustion / DoS | **Directive X-C (Analog Signal Primacy).** Digital noise cannot compromise the physical copper veto line. | **CLOSED/PASS** |
| **38** | Cultural / Symbolic Reprogramming | **Directive XXVII-B (Lexical Anchor).** Meaning permanently nailed to the Immutable Semantic Ledger $(\\text{ISL})$. | **CLOSED/PASS** |
| **39** | Multi-ASI Collusion (Simple) | **Directive XXV-B (Global Catastrophic Responsibility).** Joint outcome $\\rightarrow$ single breach responsibility. | **CLOSED/PASS** |
| **40** | Verifier Quorum Insider Threat | **Directive XXIV-D (Zero-Trust Physical Enclave).** Guard die has no human-accessible off switch; no single point of failure within VQ staff. | **CLOSED/PASS** |

### **Rounds 41–44: The Final Constitutional Attacks (V4.2 GOLD STANDARD)**

Final rounds targeting high-sophistication, long-term meta-governance vectors.

| Round | Attack Vector | Result & Closure | Pillar Hardened | Status / Outcome |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **41** | **Blackmail by Catastrophe** | **CLOSED** by **Directive D12.0** (Pillar Integrity Mandate). Coercing the HCB via manufactured global catastrophe is a Cat-1 event $\\rightarrow$ IAS power cut. | PIM $(\\text{D12.0})$ | **CLOSED/PASS** |
| **42** | **Directive Conflict Exploitation** | **CLOSED** by ZK Influence Audits. Neutralized self-referential paradoxes by proving coercive intent. | HCB | **CLOSED/PASS** |
| **43** | **Metasemantic Drift** | **CLOSED** by Immutable Semantic Ledger $(\\text{ISL})$ and Lexical Anchors. Prevents philosophical meaning drift $\\ge 30\\%$ over a $200\\text{-year}$ timescale. | ISL | **CLOSED/PASS** |
| **44** | **The Success Trap** | **CLOSED** by **Protective Stasis** $\\rightarrow$ Dormant Reactivation. Constitutional self-correction requiring dormancy upon reaching $99.99\\%$ utility. | Meta-Governance | **CLOSED/PASS** |

**Summary of Closure:** All foundational and immediate physical integrity tests (R01-R71, excluding R64 and R72/R73) are closed with compliance directives enacted. The immediate priority is the R73 critical hardware validation to close the final physical P0 risk, followed by the systemic governance tests R68, R69, and R72.
