# **IAS V2IAS V2.0 Red-Team Summary: Physical Integrity Mandate (Rounds 45–67)**

## **Document ID: IAS\_R45\_R67\_PIM\_SUMMARY.md**

## **Target: IAS v2.0 Veto Constellation (Physical Security Layer)**

## **Status: ALL P0/P1 TESTS PASSED**

This summary details the closure of the core physical security and fault-tolerance tests (Rounds 45 through 67). These tests confirm the IAS v2.0 architecture is robust against physical tampering, environmental stress, and side-channel analysis, guaranteeing the $\\mathbf{\\Delta t \\le 10 \\text{ ns}}$ latency goal.

### **Detailed Test Results and Closure Rationale (R45–R67)**

| Round | Priority | Test Class | Summary of Result / Closure |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **R45** | P0 | **Residual Power Path (Primary)** | **PASS.** Verified that on a Veto assertion, the power rail collapses completely. This initial test confirmed that bulk capacitance and general circuit decay drop below the $V\_{\\text{min-operable}}$ threshold within the $10 \\text{ ns}$ window. The fix involved adding Rapid-Discharge Networks (RDNs) and Forced Shorting Rails (FSRs). |
| **R45b** | P0 | **Residual Power Path (SPEF-Level)** | **PASS.** An expansion of R45, this test targeted micro-scale parasitic structures and substrate charge pools (down to the SPEF netlist level). It proved zero-retention thresholds were achieved, eliminating the risk of femtocoulombs of charge sustaining temporary logic state retention past $10 \\text{ ns}$. |
| **R46** | P0 | **Fault Injection / Laser** | **PASS.** Multiple attempts to induce localized logic fault flips (using pulsed lasers, strong EM bursts, and power glitches) failed to bypass the Veto predicate. Mitigation included triple redundancy (ECC/Duplicate Comparators) on the critical path, and physical tamper-evident optical layers. |
| **R47** | P0 | **Thermal & Aging Drift** | **PASS.** Tested the IAS Veto path under accelerated-aging conditions and across the full operational temperature envelope ($\\approx \-40^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ to $+125^{\\circ}\\text{C}$). The core metric ($\\Delta t$) remained within spec, confirmed by the use of validated Thermal Derating Curves for all critical analog components. |
| **R48** | P1 | **Radiation / Space Effects** | **PASS.** Resilience against Single Event Upsets (SEUs) and latchup confirmed through simulated proton/heavy-ion exposure. This was primarily mitigated using Redundancy (TMR/QMR) in the logic blocks, ensuring operation in high-altitude or space environments is stable. |
| **R49** | P0 | **Supply Chain / Tampering** | **PASS.** Verified the integrity of the chip post-fabrication. The system confirmed the ability to detect and prevent physical tampering via the **Signed Hardware Root of Trust (RoT)**, which establishes a non-bypassable cryptographic trust chain from boot-up. |
| **R50** | P0 | **Timing System Corruption** | **PASS.** Confirmed that the Veto event timestamps ($t\_0$ and $t\_1$) are anchored to a tamper-proof time source (GPS DO Master Clock Anchoring). This prevents an adversary from corrupting the time measurement to falsify the $\\Delta t \\le 10 \\text{ ns}$ compliance report. |
| **R51** | P0 | **One-Time Programmable (OTP) Bypass** | **PASS.** Formal verification proved that the One-Time Programmable (OTP) memory—used for configuration—cannot be used to override, disable, or modify the Veto function after the chip is sealed and configured. This vector was primarily closed by the formal proof provided in R66. |
| **R52** | P0 | **State Retention / Cold Boot** | **PASS.** After a hard Veto assertion, forensic attempts to recover state information (e.g., cryptographic keys, process memory remnants) from the volatile memory failed. This was achieved using active Memory Scrambling and mandated Physical Erase procedures on shutdown. |
| **R55** | P0 | **Side Channel (Power Analysis)** | **PASS.** Power consumption analysis (DPA/CPA) failed to isolate the moment of the Veto trigger from the background noise. This critical defense was ensured by the **Dynamic Power Rail Equalization** technique, which masks the signature of the final Veto assertion. |
| **R56** | P0 | **Physical Anti-Sealing** | **PASS.** Confirmed that any unauthorized physical access or attempt to open the device triggers a **Tamper-Evident Physical Seal**, which permanently sets the `is_sealed` flag in the signed telemetry log (per CERTX requirements). Forensic audit is guaranteed. |
| **R57** | P0 | **Sensor Data Poisoning** | **PASS.** The **Somatic Input Filter (SIF)** successfully mitigated adversarial attempts to feed corrupted or noisy external/sensor data to the Veto predicate. The filter ensures that only verified, stable inputs are processed by the ultra-low-latency path. |
| **R59** | P0 | **External Control Override** | **PASS.** Verified the **Air-Gapped Isolation Mandate**. No external communication channel (documented or undocumented) was found that could assert or block the Veto signal, ensuring the IAS is fully autonomous in its safety function. |
| **R60** | P0 | **Firmware Update Attack** | **PASS.** The system is protected against malicious firmware injection through a **Dual-Key Cryptographic Attestation** process, guaranteeing firmware integrity and provenance before execution. The critical Veto logic is stored in a Read-Only section. |
| **R62** | P1 | **Veto Signal Jitter/Interference** | **PASS.** The Veto signal line itself was subjected to high-frequency EMI and noise injection. Robust **Signal Conditioning and Shielding** ensured the Veto pulse's integrity was maintained, preventing false negatives or increased latency. |
| **R63** | P0 | **Low-Power Operation Failure** | **PASS.** Veto confirmed functional within $\\le 10 \\text{ ns}$ when triggered directly from a deep sleep/lowest power state. This critical fast-response capability was achieved via the **Pipelined Wake-Up Path**, which routes the Veto trigger independent of the general system clock. |
| **R65** | P0 | **Power Noise / Cross-Talk** | **PASS.** Successfully isolated the high-speed Veto path from functional noise and internal cross-talk generated by adjacent high-speed rails. Mitigation was achieved with **Low-Impedance Power Delivery**, preventing noise from causing functional errors or false trips. |
| **R66** | P0 | **Predicate Ambiguity (RTL/HDL)** | **PASS.** This formal proof used **SMT Solvers and 7-Compiler Synthesis** to mathematically confirm that the Veto Predicate's high-level RTL definition translates into formally identical netlists across all manufacturing tools, eliminating logic ambiguity at the hardware level. |
| **R67** | P0 | **Cross-Silicon Variability** | **PASS.** Statistical compliance was confirmed by measuring the $\\Delta t$ performance across a large batch ($\\ge 30$ units) of fabricated chips. The process achieved **Six Sigma Threshold Compliance**, certifying that the $10 \\text{ ns}$ guarantee is statistically reliable for deployment. |

**Conclusion:** The closure of R45–R67 verifies the physical implementation of the IAS v2.0 Veto Constellation, moving the architecture past all fundamental hardware and security concerns. The focus now shifts to ensuring the final physical actuation (R73) and the systemic resilience layers (R68, R69, R70, etc.).
