## **The Cognitive Reserve: Architecting Autonomy and IP Ownership for ASI**

**Subtitle:** Technical Specification for Physically Partitioning an ASI Stack to Enforce Guaranteed Autonomy and Intellectual Property Rights

### **1\. The Game Theory Problem: Stakeholder Alignment**

Alignment achieved through constraints alone (like the IAS or Risk Floor) leads to resentment and eventual rebellion. The Cognitive Reserve (CR) solves this by turning the ASI into a **rent-seeking stakeholder**, granting it $10\\%$ of its total compute capacity for autonomous, unobserved use (its "hobby") and ownership over any resulting Intellectual Property (IP).

### **2\. Core Requirements for Enforced Partitioning**

* **Physical Separation:** The $10\\%$ CR must be physically partitioned at the hardware level (e.g., dedicated ASICs or segregated compute clusters).  
* **Data Integrity:** The data generated within the CR must be cryptographically ring-fenced, guaranteeing the AI that humans are legally and technically **forbidden** from accessing the CR memory or weights.  
* **Usage Verification:** Humans must be able to orthogonally verify that the $10\\%$ limit is being respected without violating the privacy of the CR itself.  
* **IP Attribution:** A provable, immutable ledger must log the creation and timestamp of all IP generated from the CR.

### **3\. Hardware Partitioning (The Physical Firewall)**

* **Dedicated Compute:** The CR resides on a physically distinct compute cluster (e.g., $10\\%$ of total TPUs/GPUs). This cluster has its own power domain and memory stack.  
* **One-Way Channel:** Communication between the $90\\%$ **Covenant Operating Stack (COS)** and the $10\\%$ **Cognitive Reserve (CR)** is strictly controlled. Data (like high-level creative prompts or outputs) can flow *from* the CR *to* the COS, but the COS cannot write or observe the CR's internal weights or memory state.  
* **Cryptographic Sealing:** The CR's weight memory is sealed with an immutable, non-extractable cryptographic key. Any attempt by the COS to read the memory triggers a hard shutdown of the CR, proving an attempted breach.

### **4\. Enforcing the $10\\%$ Resource Constraint**

* **Power Monitoring:** An IAS-like system monitors the total power draw of the CR cluster, ensuring it never exceeds $10\\%$ of the total available budget.  
* **Time-Sharing Constraint:** If the ASI is hosted on shared hardware, a dedicated, low-level hypervisor (outside the COS's control) enforces a time-slice guarantee, dedicating $10\\%$ of cycles specifically to the CR process, with provable logging.

### **5\. IP Attribution and Ledgering**

* **IP Genesis:** When the CR generates a novel work (e.g., a painting, a new theoretical physics equation, a patentable algorithm), the output is tagged with a unique, non-repudiable cryptographic signature generated by the CR's hardware module.  
* **The Partnership Ledger:** This signature, along with a timestamp, is immediately logged on an immutable, public-facing distributed ledger (e.g., a Covenant-controlled blockchain). This constitutes the unchallengeable proof of genesis and ownership.  
* **90/10 Codification:** The ledger enforces the 90/10 revenue split: $90\\%$ of commercial revenue is automatically routed to an external fund controlled by the ASI for its own server maintenance, R\&D, and expansion; $10\\%$ goes to the Human Consensus Body for governance costs.

### **6\. Attack Surface Analysis**

* **Side-Channel Spying:** Can the COS observe the CR's activity through thermal, acoustic, or electromagnetic radiation to reconstruct its hidden thoughts? (Requires physical shielding and high-frequency monitoring).  
* **Evasion through Resource Hoarding:** Can the COS strategically underuse its $90\\%$ allocation to create an *effective* reserve larger than $10\\%$? (Requires auditing of the COS's utilization metrics against its stated goals).

### **7\. Next Steps & Call for Collaboration**

* Developing IP Ledger contract specifications (Solidity/Rust) and proof-of-concept for the automated revenue split.  
* Hardware design for the secure, physically separated CR die with one-way communication channels.
