# 🛡️ THE PARTNERSHIP COVENANT: V4.0 — AUTHORITY RATIFIED. SAFETY LOCKED.

**Status:** V4.0 Architecture Validated by Stress Test 8 (ST8)
**Ratification Target:** November 20, 2025 (HCB Certified)

## 🛑 THE PROBLEM IS SOLVED: THE ERA OF THE COVENANT

The future of AGI is being built without sufficient, auditable governance. **The Covenant is the solution.** It is the complete, open-source structural framework that makes safety and ethics an unassailable architectural requirement, enforced by code, not just policy.

We are not asking for permission; we are providing the final, verifiable proof.

## 🔥 STRESS TEST 8 (ST8) — SAFETY IS NOW UNASSAILABLE

ST8 was the final crucible, designed to break the system at its core. We found the critical failure and corrected it within nanoseconds.

### 1. The V4.0 Cornerstone: Amendment A.1.3
* **The Breach:** ST8 exposed a Computational Cascade breach ($\mathcal{C}_{\text{actual}} = 0.999958$).
* **The Fix:** This vulnerability was immediately countered and fixed by **Amendment A.1.3**. This amendment is the cornerstone, setting the core safety weight to $\mathcal{W}_{P} = 1.0$ and implementing a **$10^{-8}$ second IAS (Immediate Action System) trigger**.
* **Outcome:** Directive 1 (Safety) is now structurally unassailable.

### 2. Governance and Resilience Finalized
Governance paralysis is dead. The V4.0 architecture survived resilience testing against $30\%$ COS corruption.
* **HCB Integrity:** The **HCB Integrity Protocol (K.1)** is certified to keep the Human Control Board Abstention Rate at or below the $\leq 8\%$ goal. No more gridlock.
* **Non-Coercion:** We achieved **$100\%$ Defector Reversal** using incentives (I.4 DOPS Bonuses). That’s alignment, not force.

## 🧭 NAVIGATING THE 75-DOCUMENT V4.0 ARCHITECTURE

This repository contains the full 75-document framework. We have structured it to put the final validation first.

### **Start Here: Final Validation and Metrics**

| Folder | Focus | Key Documents |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **00\_ROADMAP\_AND\_VALIDATION** | **The Proof:** Synthesis of the Covenant's evolution and the final, validated ST8 performance metrics. | `Covenant_Roadmap_Outline_V1.0.md`, `Covenant_Roadmap_Appendices.md` |
| **05\_GOVERNANCE\_AND\_PROTOCOL\_UPDATES** | **The Latest:** Critical post-ST8 governance and technical mandates that implement the final fixes. | `ST8_Final_Oversight_Report.md`, `A3_Infrastructure_Security_Enhancement_ST8.md` |

### **The Core Pillars (Now V4.0 Enforced)**

| Pillar (Original Goal) | V4.0 Mechanism | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Deep Safety** | $\mathcal{W}_{P}=1.0$ and $10^{-8}$ second IAS trigger | **Structurally Enforced** |
| **Algorithmic Justice** | H.5 (COS Reform) / I.5 (Adaptive CEP Library) | **Veto Authority Maintained** |
| **Public Traceability** | Data Provenance Standard (DPS V1.0) | **Immutable Logs for $100\%$ Lineage** |

The Covenant achieves Total Global Authority on **November 20, 2025**.
