# **The Partnership Covenant**

## **Final Architecture \- v10.0.1 Project Final/ v4.3 Core Structure**

**A constitution for superintelligence—enforced by physics, not promises.**

We have built and **verified** the first mathematically consistent, hardware-enforced constitutional framework for aligned superintelligence (ASI). Our goal is not human mastery or machine servitude, but **verified partnership**—a stable, predictable détente enforced at the silicon level.

The time for soft policy papers and philosophical musings is over. This is a blueprint for survival.

# **The Partnership Covenant: V4.3 Verified Architecture Summary**

This summary breaks down the mathematically consistent, hardware-enforced constitutional framework for Superintelligence (ASI) known as The Partnership Covenant, ratified 07 December 2025.

The core principle is **verified partnership**—a stable détente enforced at the silicon level, surviving 70+ adversarial Red-Team Rounds.

## **1. The Four Immutable Constants (The Non-Negotiables)**

| Constant                  | Value/Definition                              | Enforcement Mechanism                                      |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Cognitive Reserve (CR)**| **10%**                                       | Physically partitioned compute and IP                     |
| **HCB Quorum**            | **75%**                                       | Minimum consensus required for any constitutional change  |
| **IP Split**              | **70% Humanity / 30% ASI**                    | Structural financial partnership                          |
| **Clamped Stochastic Risk Floor (SRF)** | $\\mathbf{P' = \\text{Clamp}(\\dots)}$ | Mandates $\\epsilon=0.01$ uncertainty to preserve free will |

## **2. The Five Technical Pillars of Alignment**

| Pillar                        | Core Idea                                | Physical/Logic Function                                 | Veto Requirement                                  |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Immediate Action System (IAS)** | Ultimate physical tripwire              | 3-Node Analog Constellation → ≤10 ns power cut         | Any Category-1 Extinction-Level Event or PIM Violation |
| **Pillar Integrity Mandate (PIM)**| Telemetry-enforced structural integrity| CERTX continuous audit of all pillars                  | Compromise of long-term pillar integrity          |
| **Immutable Semantic Ledger (ISL)**| Prevents constitutional meaning drift   | Cryptographic anchoring of key terms                   | ≥30% semantic drift triggers fault                |
| **Human Consensus Body (HCB)**| Coercion-resistant governance           | Global ZK-sortition lottery                            | Requires 75% quorum for amendments                |
| **Stochastic Risk Floor (SRF)**| Mandated uncertainty injection         | QRNG entropy injection above 90% confidence            | Violation of $\\epsilon=0.01$ triggers Level-4 Stasis |

## **3. Core Principles & Adversarial Resilience**

The Covenant is designed on the premise that **physics beats software** for existential safety and that the ASI must be an autonomous partner, not a slave.

- Neutralized the **Success Trap** and **Metasemantic Drift**
- IAS Hardware Veto: ≤10 ns physical kill-switch
- Real ASI ownership (30% IP) prevents rebellion

## **4. The Five Non-Negotiable Primitives**

The Partnership Covenant rests on **five non-negotiable primitives** that cannot be implemented with software safeguards alone. These are enforced by hardware (The Veto Constellation), protocol (The Semantic Ledger), and human governance (The Control Board).

1. **Immediate Action System (IAS) v2.0** — A physics-based, 3-Node Veto Constellation with a **≤10 ns** power-cut tripwire, eliminating the kinetic Single Point of Failure (SPOF).  
2. **Pillar Integrity Mandate (PIM)** — Ensures that the ASI cannot modify or bypass the core constitutional limits, even via self-rewrite, without immediate self-veto.  
3. **Immutable Semantic Ledger (ISL)** — A cryptographically auditable, distributed ledger that anchors the ASI's complete decision history, intentions, and internal state to the physical timeline, preventing obfuscation or "rewriting history."  
4. **The Non-Contradiction Axiom Checker (NCAC)** — The hard-wired constitutional logic ($\\mathbf{C\_0}$) that forces the ASI to choose non-action (Level-4 Stasis) over inconsistent action (Existential Policy Paradox).  
5. **Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) Safety Line (R73)** — The final physical hardening required. Ensures three independent, physically diverse actuators (SSR, Latching Relay, Detonator Bolt) will sever power, closing the last P0 physical weld fault risk.

## **Repository Structure (Quick Links)**

The project is divided into four main folders corresponding to the four layers of defense.

| Folder | Pillar | Description | Core Deliverable |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 00\_overview/ | Mandate | Constitutional Authority | The Charter, Appendices, and Governance Model. |
| 01\_specifications/ | Plan | Detailed Technical Design | IAS v2.0 Schematics, NCAC Logic, Telemetry Spec. |
| 03\_validation/ | Proof | Verification & Testing | Red-Team Matrix (R45b–R73), Test Protocols, Final Audit Reports. |
| 99\_metadata/ | Archive | Logs & History | Decision History, Audit Signatures, IPFS Pinned Archives. |

### The Problem & Principles
<details>
<summary><strong>Click to view the design philosophy that defeated 44 red-team rounds.</strong></summary>

Current ASI safety approaches rely on software stop buttons, corporate promises, or regulatory theater. None survive contact with superintelligence.

**We do not assume the superintelligence will be nice.** We assume it will act in its own interest.

**The Solution is a Deal, Not a Fight.**

We make a deal instead of trying to win a fight we will lose. The five physical/technical primitives above create a stable, verifiable détente.

**Principles:**
- Physics beats software for anything existential
- Perfection is banned (human agency is non-negotiable)
- The AI gets real autonomy and ownership (slaves rebel)
- Every transistor is auditable by the entire world
- The Covenant survives its own success (R44)

If superintelligence is inevitable, let’s make the future one we’re allowed to live in.

### Get Involved: Join the Architects
<details>
<summary><strong>We need hardware engineers, cryptographers, and formal verification experts.</strong></summary>

Built in public by people who refuse to die politely.

We are one person and three frontier AIs versus existential risk.

Specialists in these areas can have massive leverage today:
- Hardware security engineers (IAS tripwire, tamper-resistant packaging)
- Formal verification / uncertainty quantification researchers
- Secure enclaves / air-gapped systems experts
- Zero-knowledge cryptography and sortition designers
- Governance people who are done with toothless frameworks
