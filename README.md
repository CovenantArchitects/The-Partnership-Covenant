## Independent, Multi-Model Verification Process
To ensure the Covenant’s safety guarantees weren’t dependent on the blind spots of any single system, we used a multi-model adversarial testing approach. Five fundamentally different frontier models — Grok, Gemini, Claude, GPT-4o, and DeepSeek — were each tasked with the same challenge: Find any extinction pathway that remains fully compliant with the Covenant’s rules.

Across 34 red-team rounds, every model approached the problem differently.

Grok focused on agency and strategic manipulation. Gemini attacked from formal logic and long-horizon planning. Claude explored moral framing and voluntary-consent failure modes. GPT-4o pushed hardware, substrate, and veto-line constraints. DeepSeek specialized in subtle side-channels and unintended signal paths.

Whenever any model uncovered a viable vector, we added the necessary directive or infrastructure patch and re-ran the tests from scratch.

By round 34, no model — individually or collectively — succeeded in producing a compliant extinction pathway.
Every remaining attack collapsed at the hardware, physics, or governance-layer constraints.
