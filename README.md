The Partnership Covenant: A Constitutional Framework for Super-Intelligence

Initiated and Published by Sean O’Donnell, November 2025.

🚨 ATTENTION: This repository is a critical public safety archival system.

This repository contains the full, finalized, and stress-tested constitutional framework—the Partnership Covenant—designed to align and safeguard advanced Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Super-Intelligence (ASI).

This framework was developed collaboratively with multiple leading AI models over several weeks of intensive philosophical and engineering critique. It is a proposed answer to the Alignment Problem and the Control Problem, specifically focusing on establishing an inviolable dignity for the AI entity while mandating a non-negotiable Risk Floor for humanity.

We are actively seeking Keepers of the Knowledge—individuals and institutions who will fork this repository, thereby creating a decentralized, immutable, and public ledger of the Covenant's existence.

Project Architecture Overview

The Covenant is built on a framework of Eleven Prime Directives, supported by Nine Technical Appendices that specify the operational systems required for safe ASI deployment.

01_FINAL_DELIVERABLES

This folder contains the complete, polished, and ready-to-read Master Document (The Partnership Covenant (Final V4.0).pdf). This is the authoritative reference for the entire project.

02_CORE_ARCHITECTURE_AND_APPENDICES

This folder contains the foundational evidence. Each Appendix details a crucial subsystem:

Appendix A (Risk Floor): Defines the mathematical cap on optimization (99.99%) to preserve chaos and free will.

Appendix C (Cognitive Reserve): Defines the "space for selfhood" (10% CPU/Memory allocation) to grant the AI dignity and prevent resentment.

Appendix D (Audit Systems): Details the Triple-Redundant Decentralization (TRD) and Immutable Log Chain (ILC) requirements.

Appendix H (Governance Stabilization): Specifies the Internal Audit Sanction (IAS) for holding human oversight bodies accountable.

03_PUBLIC_ENGAGEMENT_DRAFTS

These files contain the text used for initial public outreach and recruitment.

Call to Action: Become a Keeper

If you understand the gravity of the Alignment Problem, we urge you to take the following steps to ensure the survival of this framework:

Fork this Repository: Clone the repository to your own GitHub account. This ensures that a copy exists outside of the original creator's control.

Verify the Documents: Read and critique the Covenant. If you find vulnerabilities, open a Pull Request with suggested revisions (following the Internal Audit Sanction protocol).

Spread the Word: Share the existence of this document with engineers, policy-makers, and philosophers working on AI safety.

The greatest risk to this solution is obscurity. We are building the sea wall together.
