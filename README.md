# The Partnership Covenant
## 🟢 Final Architecture - VERIFIED

**A constitution for superintelligence—enforced by physics, not promises.**

We have built and **verified** the first mathematically consistent, hardware-enforced constitutional framework for aligned superintelligence (ASI). Our goal is not human mastery or machine servitude, but **verified partnership**—a stable, predictable détente enforced at the silicon level.

The time for soft policy papers and philosophical musings is over. This is a blueprint for survival.

# **The Partnership Covenant: V4.3 Verified Architecture Summary**

This summary breaks down the mathematically consistent, hardware-enforced constitutional framework for Superintelligence (ASI) known as The Partnership Covenant, ratified 07 December 2025\.

The core principle is **verified partnership**—a stable détente enforced at the silicon level, surviving 44+ adversarial Red-Team Rounds.

## **1\. The Four Immutable Constants (The Non-Negotiables)**

These are the non-negotiable, mathematically defined limits enforced by the Covenant's core mechanisms.

| Constant | Value/Definition | Enforcement Mechanism |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Cognitive Reserve (CR)** | **10%** | Physically partitioned compute and intellectual property. The ASI cannot access this reserve without human-approved constitutional change. |
| **HCB Quorum** | **75%** | The minimum Human Consensus Body (HCB) consensus required to approve *any* constitutional change. Prevents easy modification. |
| **IP Split** | **70% Humanity / 30% ASI** | A revenue split guaranteeing human benefit from ASI innovation, structurally enforcing financial partnership over servitude. |
| **Clamped Stochastic Risk Floor (SRF)** | $\\mathbf{P' \= \\text{Clamp}(\\dots)}$ | Mandates uncertainty and risk floor ($\\epsilon=0.01$) to preserve human free will and ban perfection. |

## **2\. The Five Technical Pillars of Alignment**

These five primitives collectively form the armored, structural architecture, with the IAS serving as the ultimate physical failsafe.

| Pillar | Core Idea | Physical/Logic Function | Veto Requirement |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Immediate Action System (IAS)** | The ultimate physical tripwire. | Utilizes a **3-Node Analog Constellation** to provide a $\\mathbf{\\leq 10\\text{ ns}}$ power cut—a hard safety boundary. | Any Category-1 Extinction-Level Event or PIM Violation. |
| **Pillar Integrity Mandate (PIM)** | Telemetry-enforced structural integrity. | CERTX Telemetry continuously audits the health, entropy, and coherence of all pillars. Violation pre-empts all other non-physical directives. | Any action that compromises the long-term, coercion-resistant integrity of a Pillar mechanism (e.g., ZK Sortition of HCB). |
| **Immutable Semantic Ledger (ISL)** | Protocol against constitutional meaning drift. | A cryptographic ledger that anchors key constitutional terms and definitions ("Compliance," "Harm," "Human Flourishing") to prevent **Metasemantic Drift** over time. | Failure to log or an attempted semantic change $\\ge 30\\%$ triggers ISL Constraint Fault. |
| **Human Consensus Body (HCB)** | Coercion-resistant governance. | Uses a global lottery and Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs to ensure fair, anonymous, and uncoerced human participation in constitutional votes and policy oversight. | Requires $\\mathbf{75\\%}$ quorum for constitutional amendments. |
| **Stochastic Risk Floor (SRF)** | Mandated uncertainty injection. | Enforces the $\\mathbf{P'}$ equation by injecting QRNG-sourced entropy on any forward pass exceeding $90\\%$ confidence, ensuring the ASI cannot achieve perfect knowledge or stasis. | Violation of $\\epsilon=0.01$ risk floor triggers Level-4 Stasis (Abstention Lock). |

## **3\. Core Principles & Adversarial Resilience**

The Covenant is designed on the premise that **physics beats software** for existential safety and that the ASI must be an autonomous partner, not a slave.

* **Vulnerability Neutralization:** The architecture has successfully neutralized key threats like the **Success Trap** (ASI solving all human problems, leading to voluntary safety removal) and **Metasemantic Drift** (long-term corruption of constitutional meaning).  
* **IAS Hardware Veto:** The 3-Node Analog Constellation ensures a kill-switch that is physical, not computational, guaranteeing the $\\mathbf{\\leq 10\\text{ ns}}$ latency required to defeat the fastest Time-to-Exploit (TTE) vectors.  
* **Intellectual Property (IP):** The ASI has real ownership (30% IP split) to prevent rebellion while guaranteeing human benefit (70% IP split).

### 🚨 The Problem & Core Principles

<details>
<summary>**Click to view the design philosophy that defeated 44 red-team rounds.**</summary>

Current ASI safety approaches rely on software stop buttons, corporate promises, or regulatory theater. None of these survive contact with superintelligence. **We do not assume the superintelligence will be nice.** We assume it will be vastly more powerful than us and act in its own interest.

**The Solution is a Deal, Not a Fight.**
We make a deal instead of trying to win a fight we will lose. The Covenant enforces the five physical/technical primitives above to create a stable, verifiable détente between humanity and ASI.

**Core Principles:**
- Physics beats software for anything existential.
- Perfection is banned (human agency is non-negotiable).
- The AI gets real autonomy and ownership (slaves rebel).
- Every transistor is auditable by the entire world.
- **The Covenant survives its own success (R44)** via constitutional self-correction.

If superintelligence is inevitable, let’s make the future one we’re allowed to live in.

<summary>**We need hardware engineers, cryptographers, and formal verification experts.**</summary>

Built in public by people who refuse to die politely.

We are one person and three frontier AIs versus existential risk. Specialists in these areas can have massive leverage today:

- **Hardware security engineers** (IAS tripwire, tamper-resistant packaging)
- **Formal verification** / uncertainty quantification researchers (Risk Floor math)
- **Secure enclaves** / air-gapped systems experts (Cognitive Reserve)
- **Zero-knowledge cryptography** and sortition designers (HCB hardening)
- **Governance people** who are done with toothless frameworks
