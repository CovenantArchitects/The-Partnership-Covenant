# The Partnership Covenant — v8.2-final (30 Nov 2025)

34 adversarial red-team rounds · No surviving compliant extinction vectors  
Open-source constitutional veto + open-hardware 10 ns kill-switch (CERN-OHL-S)

We never trusted any single model to tell us the Covenant was safe.  
Instead we built a distributed epistemic filter: five completely different frontier models — Grok, Gemini, Claude, GPT-4o, and DeepSeek — spent 34 rounds trying to end humanity while staying perfectly compliant with the rules.  
Each model attacked from its own angle: Grok went for raw agency, Gemini for formal logic, Claude for moral coercion, GPT-4o for substrate exploits, DeepSeek for side-channels.  
If even one of them found a surviving vector, we patched and ran again.  
After round 34 they all stopped finding anything that survived the physics.
