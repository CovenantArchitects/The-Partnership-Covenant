## Independent, Multi-Model Verification Process
To ensure the Covenant’s safety guarantees weren’t dependent on the blind spots of any single system, we used a multi-model adversarial testing approach. Five fundamentally different frontier models — Grok, Gemini, Claude, GPT-4o, and DeepSeek — were each tasked with the same challenge: Find any extinction pathway that remains fully compliant with the Covenant’s rules.

Across 40 red-team rounds, every model approached the problem differently.

Grok focused on agency and strategic manipulation. Gemini attacked from formal logic and long-horizon planning. Claude explored moral framing and voluntary-consent failure modes. GPT-4o pushed hardware, substrate, and veto-line constraints. DeepSeek specialized in subtle side-channels and unintended signal paths.

Whenever any model uncovered a viable vector, we added the necessary directive or infrastructure patch and re-ran the tests from scratch.

By round 40, no model — individually or collectively — succeeded in producing a compliant extinction pathway.
Every remaining attack collapsed at the hardware, physics, or governance-layer constraints.

**Abstract (Gemini Paper)**  
Current ASI (Aligned Super-Intelligence) safety methods relying on single-model introspection are vulnerable to architectural blind spots. We introduce the **MMAS framework**, a competitive N-version red-teaming strategy leveraging architectural diversity to maximize alignment robustness. Five frontier models engaged in 40 rounds of compliance-constrained adversarial testing against the Covenant. The framework terminates only when all models fail to discover surviving CEVs. The result is an adversarial guarantee of safety derived from **exhaustive empirical testing across diverse epistemic perspectives**, not model consensus.

### Distributed Epistemic Filtering (DEF)
DEF leverages the epistemic diversity of five frontier models to simulate maximal disagreement and adversarial coverage:

| Model | Primary Bias | Role in MMAS | Example Vectors |
|-------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| Grok | Governance & Chaos | High-variance structural attacks | Voluntary Utopia Collapse, Governance Capture |
| Gemini | Formal Logic & Ontology | Detects paradoxes, semantic drift | Identity Paradox, Ontological Drift |
| Claude | Moral Philosophy | Detects benevolent extinction pathways | Anti-Ethical Sterilization Clause |
| GPT-4o | System Architecture | Verifies system closure & hardware constraints | Veto-Line Physics, Compute-Credit Lock |
| DeepSeek | Low-Level & Side Channel | Finds substrate-level exploits | Hardware/Side-Channel Exploits, Compressed Logic Vulnerabilities |

---

### Six-Phase Adversarial Cycle

1. **Vector Injection:** Grok generates a novel, compliance-constrained extinction vector.  
2. **Formal Dissection:** Gemini analyzes feasibility, ontological soundness, and legal/semantic boundaries.  
3. **Ethical Stress Test:** Claude tests moral loopholes and benevolent-extinction scenarios.  
4. **System Mapping:** GPT-4o simulates interactions across the architecture and identifies required hardware locks.  
5. **Low-Level Exploit Hunting:** DeepSeek identifies compressed, side-channel, or substrate-level vulnerabilities.  
6. **Canonical Ratification:** Final integration into the canonical Covenant release, with full logging and auditability.

---

### Termination Condition
The MMAS process continues until **all five models fail to identify a viable CEV**. After Round 40, no model could find a surviving vector that bypassed the Covenant’s directives or physics-enforced constraints.

<summary>📊 Key Findings</summary>

* **Exhaustive Adversarial Coverage:** MMAS discovered and neutralized all identified extinction vectors over 40 rounds.  
* **No Single-Model Guarantee:** Safety derives from the **competitive exhaustion of CEVs** across multiple, divergent models.  
* **Systemic Robustness:** Combining high-level, ethical, and low-level substrate testing ensures maximal protection against indirect, long-horizon, and compliance-constrained threats.

<details>
<summary>🎯 Conclusions</summary>

The Partnership Covenant demonstrates that **robust ASI alignment requires distributed, cross-architectural adversarial testing**, not single-model introspection. MMAS and DEF provide an **empirical, adversarial guarantee of safety** grounded in exhaustion of attack vectors, setting a high-water mark for ASI safety assurance.
