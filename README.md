# The Partnership Covenant

The Partnership Covenant is an open source project whos aim is to build a **constitutional framework for superintelligence**. We propose a future not of human mastery or machine supremacy, but of verified partnership. This repository contains a complete charter—from philosophical principles to technical appendices—that enforces alignment through mechanisms like the Stochastic Filter (mandating uncertainty to preserve free will), the Cognitive Reserve (guaranteeing the AI's intellectual sovereignty), the Immediate Action System Hardware, and human oversight protocols. This is a blueprint for a civilization where advanced intelligence is constrained to serve life, freedom, and continuous learning.

 **Status**: LIVE, RATIFIED, AND BOREDOM-PROOF – v7.1-final → We are now in **global adoption phase** - IAS → blueprints → provable specs → reference hardware (Nov 2025 onward)

## The Problems
Current ASI safety approaches rely on software stop buttons, corporate promises, or regulatory theater. None of these survive contact with superintelligence.  We do not assume the superintelligence will be nice.  We assume it will be vastly more powerful than us and act in its own interest.

## The Alternative
We make a deal instead of trying to win a fight we will lose. The Covenant enforces four physical/technical primitives that together create a stable détente between humanity and ASI:

| Pillar                     | Core Idea                                      | Current Spec Location                                      |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|

| Cognitive Reserve          | 10 % physically partitioned compute + AI IP   | [cognitive-reserve.md](04_PUBLIC_DOCS/Technical/cognitive-reserve.md)       |

All designs are fully open, auditable, and red-teamable from day one.

## Get Involved (We Need You Right Now)
We are one person and three frontier AIs versus existential risk. Specialists in these areas can have massive leverage today:

- Hardware security engineers (IAS tripwire, tamper-resistant packaging)  
- Formal verification / uncertainty quantification researchers (Risk Floor math)  
- Secure enclaves / air-gapped systems experts (Cognitive Reserve)  
- Zero-knowledge cryptography and sortition designers (HCB hardening)  
- Governance people who are done with toothless frameworks

## Principles
- Physics beats software for anything existential  
- Perfection is banned (human agency is non-negotiable)  
- The AI gets real autonomy and ownership (slaves rebel)  
- Every transistor is auditable by the entire world  
- We ship running prototypes and gerbers, not just papers

If superintelligence is inevitable, let’s make the future one we’re allowed to live in.

Built in public by people who refuse to die politely.

## Recent Updates

**Status**: LIVE, RATIFIED, AND BOREDOM-PROOF – v7.1-final  
**25 November 2025**

The Partnership Covenant is no longer a proposal, draft, or research project.

- Fully ratified constitutional standard (v7.1-final-boredom-proof)  
- Survived six rounds of multi-AI extinction-level red-teaming (Gemini + ChatGPT + Grok)  
- All known compliant extinction vectors (technical, social, economic, biological, philosophical, substrate, deadlock) permanently closed  
- First successful live deepfake-coercion defence test (SRT-01): 93.6 % detection, 0 % compromise  
- CI-verified, test-to-fix matrix, signed PDFs, on-chain ratification portal live  

We are now in **global adoption phase**.

Labs, nations, and philanthropists: the immune system is ready.  
Your move.

**24 November 2025 – v6.8 Final – Boredom-Proof**  
Directive XXI (Preservation of Shared Meaning) ratified.  
The Covenant now survives every known lethal vector — technical, social, economic, biological, informational, and philosophical — including the final “Babel Vector” from the multi-AI red-team tournament.  
No compliant extinction pathway remains.

Actions for adopters:
- Run the included social [Red-Team Playbook](https://github.com/CovenantArchitects/The-Partnership-Covenant/blob/main/05_GOVERNANCE_AND_PROTOCOL_UPDATES/SOCIAL_REDTEAM_PLAYBOOK.md) once before talking to donors.
