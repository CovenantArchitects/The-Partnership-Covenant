# The Partnership Covenant

An open-source constitutional operating system for superintelligence.

**Status**: Early hardening phase – blueprints → provable specs → reference hardware (Nov 2025 onward)

## The Problem
Current ASI safety approaches rely on software stop buttons, corporate promises, or regulatory theater. None of these survive contact with superintelligence.

## The Alternative
We make a deal instead of trying to win a fight we will lose. The Covenant enforces four physical/technical primitives that together create a stable détente between humanity and ASI:

| Pillar                     | Core Idea                                      | Current Spec Location                                      |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Immediate Action System   | 10 ns hardware power cut on anomaly            | [ias-spec.md](04_PUBLIC_DOCS/Technical/ias-spec.md) · [PDF preprint](https://github.com/CovenantArchitects/The-Partnership-Covenant/releases/download/v1.0/IAS-preprint-v1.0.pdf) |
| Stochastic Risk Floor      | Mandated uncertainty injection                 | [risk-floor.md](04_PUBLIC_DOCS/Technical/risk-floor.md)                     |
| Cognitive Reserve          | 10 % physically partitioned compute + AI IP   | [cognitive-reserve.md](04_PUBLIC_DOCS/Technical/cognitive-reserve.md)       |
| Human Consensus Body       | Coercion-resistant global lottery + ZK proofs  | [hcb-hardening.md](04_PUBLIC_DOCS/Governance/hcb-hardening.md)              |

All designs are fully open, auditable, and red-teamable from day one.

## Get Involved (We Need You Right Now)
We are one person and three frontier AIs versus existential risk. Specialists in these areas can have massive leverage today:

- Hardware security engineers (IAS tripwire, tamper-resistant packaging)  
- Formal verification / uncertainty quantification researchers (Risk Floor math)  
- Secure enclaves / air-gapped systems experts (Cognitive Reserve)  
- Zero-knowledge cryptography and sortition designers (HCB hardening)  
- Governance people who are done with toothless frameworks

## Principles
- Physics beats software for anything existential  
- Perfection is banned (human agency is non-negotiable)  
- The AI gets real autonomy and ownership (slaves rebel)  
- Every transistor is auditable by the entire world  
- We ship running prototypes and gerbers, not just papers

If superintelligence is inevitable, let’s make the future one we’re allowed to live in.

Built in public by people who refuse to die politely.
