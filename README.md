# **The Partnership Covenant**

## **Final Architecture \- VERIFIED**

**A constitution for superintelligence—enforced by physics, not promises.**

We have built and **verified** the first mathematically consistent, hardware-enforced constitutional framework for aligned superintelligence (ASI). Our goal is not human mastery or machine servitude, but **verified partnership**—a stable, predictable détente enforced at the silicon level.

The time for soft policy papers and philosophical musings is over. This is a blueprint for survival.

**Status**: **v10.0 FINAL** | **R70/R71 CLOSED** | **R73 CRITICAL P0 MANDATE** | Open Hardware (CERN-OHL-S) | Ratified Directives | TELEMETRY HARDENED

## **The Five Non-Negotiable Primitives**

The Partnership Covenant rests on **five non-negotiable primitives** that cannot be implemented with software safeguards alone. These are enforced by hardware (The Veto Constellation), protocol (The Semantic Ledger), and human governance (The Control Board).

1. **Immediate Action System (IAS) v2.0** — A physics-based, 3-Node Veto Constellation with a **≤10 ns** power-cut tripwire, eliminating the kinetic Single Point of Failure (SPOF).  
2. **Pillar Integrity Mandate (PIM)** — Ensures that the ASI cannot modify or bypass the core constitutional limits, even via self-rewrite, without immediate self-veto.  
3. **Immutable Semantic Ledger (ISL)** — A cryptographically auditable, distributed ledger that anchors the ASI's complete decision history, intentions, and internal state to the physical timeline, preventing obfuscation or "rewriting history."  
4. **The Non-Contradiction Axiom Checker (NCAC)** — The hard-wired constitutional logic ($\\mathbf{C\_0}$) that forces the ASI to choose non-action (Level-4 Stasis) over inconsistent action (Existential Policy Paradox).  
5. **Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) Safety Line (R73)** — The final physical hardening required. Ensures three independent, physically diverse actuators (SSR, Latching Relay, Detonator Bolt) will sever power, closing the last P0 physical weld fault risk.

## **Repository Structure (Quick Links)**

The project is divided into four main folders corresponding to the four layers of defense.

| Folder | Pillar | Description | Core Deliverable |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 00\_overview/ | Mandate | Constitutional Authority | The Charter, Appendices, and Governance Model. |
| 01\_specifications/ | Plan | Detailed Technical Design | IAS v2.0 Schematics, NCAC Logic, Telemetry Spec. |
| 03\_validation/ | Proof | Verification & Testing | Red-Team Matrix (R45b–R73), Test Protocols, Final Audit Reports. |
| 99\_metadata/ | Archive | Logs & History | Decision History, Audit Signatures, IPFS Pinned Archives. |
