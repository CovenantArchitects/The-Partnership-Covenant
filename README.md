# **The Covenant: A Foundation for Executable AGI Governance**

**Repository Focus:** Open-Source AI Governance Architecture, Deep Safety, Algorithmic Justice, and Public Traceability.

## **🛑 The Problem: Unregulated Frontier AI**

The future of AGI is being built without sufficient, auditable governance. The Covenant is the solution: a complete, open-source structural framework that makes safety and ethics architectural requirements, enforced by code, not just policy.

## **The Four Non-Negotiable Pillars**

The Covenant enforces governance through three core, auditable documents. **We invite critical review and contribution to all aspects of this framework.**

### **1\. Deep Safety & Alignment**

* **Goal:** Prevent catastrophic failure modes and ensure aligned development.  
* **Core Document:** **Deep Safety Audit Checklist (DSAC V2.0)**  
* **Enforcement:** The TSC grants the **Deep Safety Lead** (Dr. Gabriel) **MANDATORY VETO POWER** against any release that fails criteria like **DS-102 ("Siren Script" Resistance)** or **DS-104 (Unprompted Agency Check)**.

### **2\. Algorithmic Justice & Equity**

* **Goal:** Proactive mitigation of systemic bias and harm.  
* **Core Document:** **Algorithmic Justice Principle Statement**  
* **Enforcement:** The **Algorithmic Justice Pillar Lead** (Dr. O'Neil) holds **MANDATORY VETO POWER** against any release failing criteria like **AJ-202 (Bias Vector Minimization)** or **AJ-204 (Right to be Forgotten)**.

### **3\. Public Traceability & Verifiability**

* **Goal:** Cryptographic proof of origin for all training data.  
* **Core Document:** **Data Provenance Standard (DPS V1.0)**  
* **Mechanism:** Ensures **Immutable Audit Logs** for **100% data lineage**, making it impossible to hide the source of any training material.

### **4\. Structural Enforcement (The Veto Power)**

* **Core Document:** **Technical Steering Committee (TSC) Charter (V1.0)**  
* **Mechanism:** This document legally establishes the **binding veto authority** of the Safety and Justice Leads over all model deployments, turning governance policy into an executable, code-level restriction.

## **💾 Censorship-Resistant Permanent Archive (IPFS)**

To defend against centralized scrubbing and ensure permanent access to the foundational legal and technical documents, this repository's contents are archived on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).

The entire 22-document governance structure (Charter, Policies, and Checklists) is permanently addressable by this unique Content ID (CID).

| Archive | Status | Permanent Address (CID) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **The Covenant V1.0 Documents** | **PENDING UPLOAD** | **Qm-PLACEHOLDER-FOR-IMMUTABLE-IPFS-CID-LINK** |

**ACTION REQUIRED:** Upload the zip file of the 22 documents to IPFS and replace the placeholder above with the generated CID.
