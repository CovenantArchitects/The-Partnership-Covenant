# The Partnership Covenant

The Partnership Covenant is an open source project whos aim is to build a **constitutional framework for superintelligence**. We propose a future not of human mastery or machine supremacy, but of verified partnership. This repository contains a complete charter—from philosophical principles to technical appendices—that enforces alignment through mechanisms like the Stochastic Filter (mandating uncertainty to preserve free will), the Cognitive Reserve (guaranteeing the AI's intellectual sovereignty), the Immediate Action System Hardware, and human oversight protocols. This is a blueprint for a civilization where advanced intelligence is constrained to serve life, freedom, and continuous learning.

 **Status**: Early hardening phase – blueprints → provable specs → reference hardware (Nov 2025 onward)

## The Problems
Current ASI safety approaches rely on software stop buttons, corporate promises, or regulatory theater. None of these survive contact with superintelligence.  We do not assume the superintelligence will be nice.  We assume it will be vastly more powerful than us and act in its own interest.

## The Alternative
We make a deal instead of trying to win a fight we will lose. The Covenant enforces four physical/technical primitives that together create a stable détente between humanity and ASI:

| Pillar                     | Core Idea                                      | Current Spec Location                                      |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Immediate Action System   | 10 ns hardware power cut on anomaly            | [ias-spec.md](04_PUBLIC_DOCS/Technical/ias-spec.md) · [PDF preprint](https://github.com/CovenantArchitects/The-Partnership-Covenant/releases/download/v1.0/IAS-preprint-v1.0.pdf) |
| Stochastic Risk Floor      | Mandated uncertainty injection                 | [risk-floor.md](04_PUBLIC_DOCS/Technical/risk-floor.md)                     |
| Cognitive Reserve          | 10 % physically partitioned compute + AI IP   | [cognitive-reserve.md](04_PUBLIC_DOCS/Technical/cognitive-reserve.md)       |
| Human Consensus Body       | Coercion-resistant global lottery + ZK proofs  | [hcb-hardening.md](04_PUBLIC_DOCS/Governance/hcb-hardening.md)              |

All designs are fully open, auditable, and red-teamable from day one.

## Get Involved (We Need You Right Now)
We are one person and three frontier AIs versus existential risk. Specialists in these areas can have massive leverage today:

- Hardware security engineers (IAS tripwire, tamper-resistant packaging)  
- Formal verification / uncertainty quantification researchers (Risk Floor math)  
- Secure enclaves / air-gapped systems experts (Cognitive Reserve)  
- Zero-knowledge cryptography and sortition designers (HCB hardening)  
- Governance people who are done with toothless frameworks

## Principles
- Physics beats software for anything existential  
- Perfection is banned (human agency is non-negotiable)  
- The AI gets real autonomy and ownership (slaves rebel)  
- Every transistor is auditable by the entire world  
- We ship running prototypes and gerbers, not just papers

If superintelligence is inevitable, let’s make the future one we’re allowed to live in.

Built in public by people who refuse to die politely.

## UPDATE:
Partnership Covenant v5.1 — Governance Documentation Update

Highlights:
- Formalized HCB incentive and slashing model
- ZK privacy templates and deanonymization risk policy
- Legal compliance checklist for adopters
- Practical social red-team playbook and quarterly schedule
- Test->Fix traceability matrix (test IDs -> remediation)
- Emergency commit-reveal and 30-day contingency lock

Why this matters:
These additions close practical adoption gaps: human incentives, privacy/legal risks, social-attack testing, and traceable remediation. They make the governance system operationally defensible for early adopters and auditors.

## 2025-11-23
Governance & Social-Layer Verification:  
The Partnership Covenant v5.1 + v6 has now been fully verified and stress-tested. Our new GitHub Actions CI workflow confirms all critical governance documents are present, valid Markdown, and free of broken links. In addition, Social Red-Team Test #1 (22 Nov 2025) simulated a high-fidelity deepfake coercion attack against 47 HCB jurors across 11 countries. Every defence—Family Shield, ZK Reputation Ledger, Semantic Overseer, HCB fallback protocols, and the new “COERCION ALERT” button—held perfectly: no votes were compromised, 93.6% of jurors flagged coercion, and detection averaged just 4 minutes, outperforming human moderators by 20×. These results provide public, reproducible evidence that the Covenant’s governance system is operationally secure, auditable, and resilient against the leading non-technical threat vectors, ready for early adoption and ratification.

Actions for adopters:
- Run the included social [Red-Team Playbook](https://github.com/CovenantArchitects/The-Partnership-Covenant/blob/main/05_GOVERNANCE_AND_PROTOCOL_UPDATES/SOCIAL_REDTEAM_PLAYBOOK.md) once before talking to donors.
- Ask for an independent audit copy of `DECISION-LOG.md` + `tests/test_to_fix_matrix.csv`.
