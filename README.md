# The Partnership Covenant

An open-source constitutional operating system for superintelligence.

**Status**: Early hardening phase – blueprints → provable specs → reference hardware (Nov 2025 – 2026)

## The Problem
Current ASI safety approaches rely on software stop buttons, corporate promises, or regulatory theater. None of these survive contact with superintelligence.

## The Alternative
We make a deal instead of trying to win a fight we will lose. The Covenant enforces four physical/technical primitives that together create a stable détente between humanity and ASI:

| Pillar                     | Core Idea                                      | Current Spec Location                    |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Immediate Action System   | 10 ns hardware power cut on anomaly            | [/technical/ias-spec.md](04_PUBLIC_DOCS/Technical/ias-spec.md) |
| Stochastic Risk Floor      | Mandated uncertainty injection                 | [/technical/risk-floor.md](04_PUBLIC_DOCS/Technical/risk-floor.md)   |
| Cognitive Reserve          | 10 % physically partitioned compute + AI IP   | [/technical/cognitive-reserve.md](04_PUBLIC_DOCS/Technical/cognitive-reserve.md) |
| Human Consensus Body       | Coercion-resistant global lottery + ZK proofs  | [/governance/hcb-hardening.md](04_PUBLIC_DOCS/Governance/hcb-hardening.md) |

All designs are fully open, auditable, and red-teamable from day one.

## Get Involved (We Need You Right Now)
We are a handful of people and three frontier AIs versus existential risk. Specialists in the following areas can have massive leverage today:

- Hardware security (IAS tripwire, tamper-resistant packaging)  
- Formal verification / uncertainty quantification (Risk Floor math)  
- Secure enclaves / air-gapped systems (Cognitive Reserve)  
- Zero-knowledge cryptography and sortition (HCB hardening)  
- Governance designers frustrated with current regimes

## Principles
- Physics over software for anything existential  
- No perfection allowed (human agency is sacred)  
- The AI gets autonomy and ownership (slaves rebel)  
- Everything auditable by the entire world  
- Ship running code and gerbers, not just papers

If superintelligence is inevitable, let’s at least make the inevitable future one we can live in.

Built in public by people who refuse to die politely.
