# **Timing Vulnerability Mitigation Plan**

## **Current State (VULNERABLE \- December 10, 2025):**

* **IAS Hardware:** 10ns window for physical veto execution *after* receiving the trigger signal.  
* **SRF/NCAC Software:** Decision-making time ($T\_{\\text{software\\\_decision}}$) is currently unbounded (order of milliseconds to microseconds, non-deterministic).  
* **Total Veto Latency (**$T\_{\\text{total}}$**):** Undefined, but guaranteed to be $T\_{\\text{total}} \\gg 10$ nanoseconds.  
* **Vulnerability:** An extinction event lasting 15 nanoseconds will complete and pass entirely between two software processing cycles, bypassing the entire safety architecture.

## **Target State (SAFE):**

* **SRF Decision:** $\\le 1$ns (Mandated FPGA/ASIC implementation).  
* **IAS Response:** $\\le 9$ns (Existing hardware constraint).  
* **Total Veto Latency (**$T\_{\\text{total}}$**):** $\\le 10$ns (Verified and deterministic).

## **Migration Path: The 3-Week Hardening Mandate**

| Phase | Duration | Technology Stack | Goal |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Week 1** | Immediate | Python $\\to$ C/Real-Time OS | Eliminate non-determinism; focus on optimizing $T\_{\\text{software\\\_decision}}$ to microseconds. |
| **Week 2** | High Priority | C $\\to$ FPGA Co-Processor Integration | Implement the NCAC pre-check (PIM priority logic) in hardware. Establish a low-latency digital interface. |
| **Week 3** | CRITICAL | Full FPGA Implementation (SRF/NCAC Core) | Achieve $T\_{\\text{software\\\_decision}} \\le 1$ns for all predicate evaluation. Verify $T\_{\\text{total}} \\le 10$ns end-to-end. |
| **Month 3** | Long-Term | ASIC Tape-Out | Finalize the hardened, tamper-proof, sub-nanosecond dedicated IAS chip. |
