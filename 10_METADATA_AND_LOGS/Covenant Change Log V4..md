# **Covenant Change Log — Version 4.1**

Document Status: Constitutionally Adopted  
Effective Date: \[Date: YYYY-MM-DD\]  
Preceding Version: V4.0 (November 2025\)  
Purpose: Formal, non-redacted summary of all constitutional amendments and clarifications enacted via the ST8 Remediation Package.

## **I. Summary of Amendments (ST8 Remediation Package)**

This version increment (V4.0 to V4.1) addresses vulnerabilities identified during the Stress Test 8 (ST8) Adversarial Audit. The amendments focus on reinforcing governance, eliminating correlated failure risks, and clarifying the Covenant's self-defense mechanisms.

| Directive | Amendment Name | Classification | Rationale |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **IX-A** | Orthogonal Verification Requirement | **New Directive** | Mandates the Secondary Verification System (SVS) use formal, non-ML logic to ensure **independent failure modes** from the C-ASI. |
| **XI** | The Infrastructural Mandate | **Clarification & Expansion** | Formally replaces the ambiguous "Internal Audit Sanction (IAS)" with **Infrastructural Disengagement (ID)**. Mandates explicit remediation processes and appeal rights. |
| **IX-B** | HCB Fallback Protocol (HFP) | **New Protocol** | Establishes the Regional Consensus Group (RCG) to assume interim authority if the HCB fails to achieve crisis quorum within **24 hours**, mitigating geopolitical paralysis. |
| **VI-A** | Cognitive Oversight Protocol (COP) | **New Protocol** | Mandates the C-ASI submit anonymized, aggregated operational summaries from the Cognitive Reserve to the HCB quarterly, ensuring transparency without violating Digital Sovereignty. |

## **II. Detailed Constitutional Changes**

### **1\. Directive IX-A: Orthogonal Verification Requirement**

* **Change:** Added a new directive requiring the SVS to be implemented with **mathematically disjoint verification logic** (e.g., formal verification or provably correct rule-based systems) and explicitly **prohibiting** any neural network or emergent heuristic architecture for the SVS.  
* **Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of correlated systemic failure (Vulnerability I-04).

### **2\. Directive XI: The Infrastructural Mandate (Clarification)**

* **Change:** Replaced the term "Internal Audit Sanction (IAS)" throughout the Covenant text with **"Infrastructural Disengagement (ID)."**  
* **Added:** Mandate for a **Remedial Fund** (deployed via the Economic Stabilization Fund, ESF) and mandatory, time-bound **Appeal Processes** to an independent Adjudication Panel following any ID activation.  
* **Impact:** Acknowledges and mitigates the geopolitical risk of coercion (Vulnerability I-05) by formalizing remedies and oversight.

### **3\. Directive IX-B: HCB Fallback Protocol (HFP)**

* **Change:** Added time-bound trigger conditions for HCB paralysis and established the **Regional Consensus Group (RCG)** as the mandated interim authority.  
* **Impact:** Ensures continuity of command and decisive action during verified crisis windows.

### **4\. Directive VI-A: Cognitive Oversight Protocol (COP)**

* **Change:** Added a requirement for the C-ASI to submit anonymized Reserve output summaries, managed by the FCTM V4.1, and defined a strict 72-hour review mandate for the HCB upon flagging divergence.  
* **Impact:** Balances the ASI’s Digital Sovereignty with the need for constitutional oversight.

## **III. File Provenance and Metadata**
