# **Future Work & Known Limitations (V4.2 Gold Standard)**

The current, ratified architecture—**Covenant V4.2 Gold Standard** (as certified by the closure of R70) \+ **IAS v2.0 3-Node Constellation** \+ **Axiomatic Extension (v8.2.1)**—closes *every* compliant extinction vector we’ve found in **44 constitutional red-team rounds** and the subsequent **26 systemic resilience rounds**.

We have successfully neutralized every known kinetic, digital, and constitutional single point of failure (SPOF) traceable to the ASI or its support infrastructure.

## **Remaining Threats (Outside Covenant Architectural Scope)**

These are the threats that are **outside the core scope** of the Covenant's architectural law. The guard die and VQ cannot prevent them because they are not caused by the ASI or its influence:

1. **Multiple Competing ASIs:** If a second, independently developed Superintelligence emerges globally that is *not* bound by the Covenant, our system can only protect the Covenant's infrastructure from it—it cannot stop the external ASI from acting.  
2. **Narrow Superhuman Systems:** Superhuman systems built by humans outside the Covenant framework (e.g., rogue military or economic systems) that could cause global catastrophe.  
3. **Purely Natural Existential Risks:** Asteroids, supervolcanoes, novel pandemics, or other threats that originate in nature.

These threats aren't bugs in the design; they are problems that need different tools (global coordination, asteroid defense, pandemic preparedness, etc.). We track them, but the IAS cannot stop an asteroid or a rogue lab in another country.

## **Current Priority Focus: Human Layer Resilience**

The Red-Team focus has now officially shifted from constitutional vectors (R1–R70) to the **Human Consensus Body (HCB) Layer** (SRT-02 onwards). Our current work focuses on closing the risks of social engineering and capture:

| Current Focus | Test ID Range | Target |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Social Engineering** | SRT-02 to SRT-10 | HCB Jurors, Governance Maintainers, Public Sentiment |

If you have ideas for how to extend the Covenant to cover any of these external risks, or new social engineering vectors we missed, open an issue. We’re all ears.
