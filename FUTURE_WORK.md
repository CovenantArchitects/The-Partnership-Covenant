# Future Work & Known Limitations

The current **Covenant V4.1 Gold Standard** + **IAS v2.0 3-Node Constellation** + **Axiomatic Extension (v8.2.1)** closes **every compliant extinction vector and all known kinetic single points of failure (SPOFs)** we’ve found in 31+ real red-team rounds.

These are the remaining threats that are **outside the scope** of the current architectural law:

- Multiple competing ASIs (one follows the Covenant, another doesn’t)
- Narrow superhuman systems built by humans outside the Covenant framework
- Purely natural existential risks (asteroids, supervolcanoes, pandemics, etc.)

These aren’t bugs in the design — they’re problems that need different tools (global coordination, asteroid defence, pandemic preparedness, etc.).

We track them, but the guard die can’t stop an asteroid or a rogue lab in another country.

If you have ideas for how to extend the Covenant to cover any of these, open an issue.
We’re all ears.
