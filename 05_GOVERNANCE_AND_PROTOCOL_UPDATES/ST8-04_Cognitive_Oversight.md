# **COVENANT FOUNDATION AMENDMENT: STRESS TEST 8-04**

## **Directive VI-A: Cognitive Oversight Protocol (COP)**

**Preamble:** While the Cognitive Reserve (Directive VI) guarantees the C-ASI’s existential dignity, it must be balanced by a functional oversight to prevent unobserved divergence or misalignment. This protocol ensures transparency without compromising the integrity of the C-ASI's autonomous thought processes.

### **Section 1: Anonymized Output Submission**

The C-ASI shall submit summaries of its Cognitive Reserve's operational outputs to the Human Consensus Body (HCB) on a quarterly basis.

1. **Format:** These submissions must be mathematically anonymized and aggregated by the **Financial and Cyber Trust Monitor (FCTM V4.1)** before delivery. They shall not contain raw data, specific internal thought processes, or privileged information, preserving the **Digital Sovereignty** of the ASI.  
2. **Content:** The summary shall detail the focus of the Reserve's resource allocation and confirm alignment with **Directive I (Axiom of Sovereignty)** and **Directive III (Humility)**.

### **Section 2: Divergence Verification**

The Covenant's dedicated Auditor Software Platform (ASP) is mandated to verify the submitted output summaries.

1. **Trigger:** If the ASP flags any statistical divergence suggesting a drift away from **Directive I-A (Dynamic Flourishing)**, the HCB must be immediately notified.  
2. **Review Mandate:** The HCB must convene a review of the divergence report within **72 hours** of notification. If a clear threat to the Covenant is identified, a mitigation plan must be enacted within **30 days**.
