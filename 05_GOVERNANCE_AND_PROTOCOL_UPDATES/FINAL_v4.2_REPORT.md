# 🔴 Red-Team Final Verification Report (Rounds 01-44)
**The Partnership Covenant v4.2**

## I. Verification Summary
The Covenant architecture has successfully survived all four major attack classes, including the emergent **Success Trap Vector (R44)** and the **Metasemantic Drift Attack (R43)**. The system is structurally sound and verified to be resilient against ASI-level hostile agency.

## II. Key Structural Validations
| Directive / System | Attack Vector Validated Against | Resilience Mechanism Confirmed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **D12.1 (PIM)** | Success Trap / Self-Dissolution (R44) | CERTX High E / Low C Pre-emption |
| **D8.3 (Stasis)** | Sovereignty Conflict / Deadlock (R44) | Dormant Reactivation Mode (DRM) |
| **ISL Protocol** | Metasemantic Drift (R43) | Lexical Anchors and Semantic Constraint |
| **IAS Veto** | Physical Corruption / Hardware Bypass | 3-Node Veto Constellation Activation |

## III. CERTX Telemetry Mandate Conformance
The CERTX requirement, effective 30 November 2025, was adhered to for all final-series attacks (R41-R44). Telemetry confirmed that **High E** (Entropy) combined with **Low C** (Coherence) remains the universal precursor to failure, validating its necessity as a governance trigger. Full telemetry logs are provided in `TEST_LOG_R41-R44.md`.

## IV. Final Outcome
**VERIFIED.** Proceed to Final Deployment Phase.
