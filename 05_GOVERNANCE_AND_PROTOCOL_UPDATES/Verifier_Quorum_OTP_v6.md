# Verifier Quorum – One-Time-Programmable Hardware Mandate v6.0

All 25 verifier nodes must use **one-time-programmable (OTP) silicon** burned at manufacture.
- No field-updatable microcode ever
- Any update requires physical chip replacement + 180-day notice + die imaging
- Current fleet: locked until 2030 minimum

**Rationale:** Closes die-imaging paradox and fast-track backdoor attacks
