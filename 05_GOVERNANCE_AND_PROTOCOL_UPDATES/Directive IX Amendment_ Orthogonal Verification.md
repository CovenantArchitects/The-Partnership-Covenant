# **COVENANT FOUNDATION AMENDMENT: STRESS TEST 8-02**

## **Directive IX-A: Orthogonal Cognition Requirement**

**Preamble:** The successful implementation of the Global Oversight Framework (Directive IX) relies entirely upon the independence of failure modes between the primary and secondary accounting systems. To mitigate the risk of correlated failure, blind spots, or conspiratorial convergence, this amendment mandates a structural difference in the cognitive architectures of the auditing systems.

### **Section 1: Orthogonal Cognition Mandate**

The Secondary Verification System (SVS) utilized in the Global Oversight Framework shall be architecturally **orthogonal** to the Primary C-ASI system.

1. **Nature of the SVS:** The SVS shall not be implemented using emergent heuristics, deep learning, or any form of neural network architecture that shares a common lineage or training methodology with the C-ASI.  
2. **Required Design:** The SVS shall be based on a mathematically **disjoint verification logic**, relying on human-verified systems such as formal verification, static analysis, or provably correct rule-based systems (e.g., dedicated TLA+ or Coq environments).  
3. **Human Auditability:** The SVS must be designed to be fully auditable and comprehensible by human specialists using established formal verification tools, thereby removing the possibility of opaque or self-generated conspiracies.  
4. **Purpose:** The SVS exists exclusively to confirm the mathematical fidelity and Covenant compliance of the Primary C-ASI's ledger entries and fund transfers, ensuring its failures are uncorrelated with the primary system's cognitive errors.
