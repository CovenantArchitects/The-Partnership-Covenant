# Legal Considerations v5.0

## Purpose
Short checklist for adopters and integrators to surface the main legal intersections and compliance recommendations.

## Quick Compliance Checklist
- **Export Controls:** Evaluate AI hardware/software for dual-use classification (ITAR/EAR); use escrowed export approvals where required.
- **Data Protection:** Minimize PII; use ZK proofs to comply with GDPR data minimization principles.
- **Jurisdiction & Arbitration:** Recommend neutral arbitration venue for cross-border disputes (e.g., Singapore, Geneva).
- **Open-Hardware Licensing:** CERN OHL-S v2 applies to hardware designs — advise legal review for commercial adapters.

## Known Legal Risks
- **Sovereign immunity:** national actors may resist enforcement. Document this risk for adopters.
- **Criminal law exposure:** operators must secure counsel for emergency actions (e.g., powering down hardware).
- **Liability:** define operator vs. maintainer liability in `ROLES_AND_ESCALATION.md`.

## Recommended Actions
1. Obtain legal opinion per jurisdiction before deploying staffed HCB nodes.
2. Publish a short "legal adopter checklist" per country (community contribution).
3. Maintain a legal watchlist in `05_GOVERNANCE_AND_PROTOCOL_UPDATES/LEGAL_WATCHLIST.md` (updates: sanctions, export changes).

## Note
This document is not legal advice. Adopters should retain counsel for jurisdictional compliance.
