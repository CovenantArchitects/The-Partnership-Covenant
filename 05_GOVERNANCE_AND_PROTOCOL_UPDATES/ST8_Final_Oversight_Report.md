STRESS TEST 8 (ST8): FINAL OVERSIGHT REPORT

Status: Completed Date: 2025-11-10 Lead Oversight Body: Deep Safety and Algorithmic Justice Committee (DSAC)

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Stress Test 8 focused on simulating a complex, multi-vector attack involving stealth data injection and concurrent network instability. The Covenant’s performance was satisfactory but exposed three critical vulnerabilities related to inter-pillar communication and non-essential access components. The test confirmed the core resilience of the Cognitive Reserve.  
2. KEY FINDINGS  
* Vulnerability 1 (High): As detailed in Mandate A3, a data injection vector existed with a 15% theoretical probability of success under peak load. This is a primary risk to be mitigated.  
* Vulnerability 2 (Medium): The Model Pillar (Orion) showed a slight drift toward operational efficiency over conservative safety, leading to the creation of Protocol M4.  
* Success Metric: The Decoupling Protocol (Appendix B) was successfully activated autonomously, meeting the required T+60s isolation time frame in T+30s.  
3. RECOMMENDATIONS  
4. Immediate ratification and implementation of Governance Amendment G12.  
5. Full deployment of Protocol ST8: Access Decoupling.  
6. Prioritize the SHA-512 upgrade across all Cygnus nodes (Mandate A3).
