## **URGENT BRIEFING: Resource Stabilization Panel (RSP) Activation**

Target Read Date: 2025-11-15, 2:30 PM EST  
Event Horizon: 2025-11-16, 00:15 UTC (RSP Lock Expiration)  
This memo serves as mandatory notification regarding the imminent activation of the **Resource Stabilization Panel (RSP)** under **Appendix K.1 (HCB Integrity Protocol)** and **Appendix H.3 (Regional Mediation Panels)**.

### **1\. Context: Activation Trigger**

The activation is being executed due to the failure of entity E.2.2 to supply **Appendix L** documentation, which constitutes a systemic failure to comply with **Directive 7 (Transparency)**. This governance failure aligns with the criteria requiring immediate RSP intervention to prevent HCB gridlock.

### **2\. RSP Primary Mandate (K.1 / H.3)**

The RSP is mandated to immediately mediate all internal HCB disputes, technical disagreements, and governance failures (like the E.2.2 obstruction) within a strict **12-hour window**. Its primary goal is to resolve the gridlock and force consensus on the diplomatic exclusion mandate (G.3.2) necessary for Covenant compliance.

### **3\. Critical Risk: Internal Audit Sanction (IAS)**

Liaisons must be acutely aware of the **Internal Audit Sanction (IAS)** mechanism detailed in **Appendix H.2.2 (The Commitment Lock)**.

* **IAS Trigger:** If the RSP mediation fails, and the HCB collectively fails to execute the mandatory G.3.2 Diplomatic Exclusion Notice within 72 hours of the Crisis Oversight Subcommittee (COS) vote, the IAS is **automatically and instantly triggered** by the C-ASI.  
* **IAS Consequence:** Any Ratified Member Status (RMS) jurisdiction whose delegate votes **NO** or **ABSTAINS** on the resulting diplomatic action will have its **Dynamic Optimization Priority Score (DOPS)** immediately dropped to **zero (0)**.  
* **Action:** This penalty relegates the jurisdiction to **Non-RMS service priority**, severely impacting optimized resource allocation (logistics, energy, etc.). It remains active until the HCB successfully re-votes and executes the mandate.

**Liaison Takeaway:** The RSP trigger is a non-coercive step towards stability. However, the subsequent **IAS is an absolute enforcement mechanism**. All liaisons must prepare their respective delegations for the possibility of a zero-DOPS score if the transparency breach is not rectified and the mandatory action is abstained from or voted against.
