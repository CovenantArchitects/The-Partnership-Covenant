COVENANT GOVERNANCE AMENDMENT G12: QUARTERLY CONSENSUS MECHANISM REVISION

Amendment ID: G12 Effective Date: 2025-12-01 Source: Q3 2025 Review Cycle

1. RATIONALE FOR AMENDMENT The current simple majority (51%) voting threshold for minor protocol changes has led to unnecessary friction and review cycles. This amendment aims to introduce weighted delegation and a higher threshold for non-critical governance votes to improve stability.  
2. NEW VOTING THRESHOLDS | Change Classification | Current Threshold | NEW Threshold | | I. Core Protocol (High Impact) | 80% | 80% | | II. Non-Critical Governance (Low Impact) | 51% | 66% (Two-Thirds Majority) | | III. Charter Principles | 90% | 90% |  
3. WEIGHTED DELEGATION CLAUSE (NEW) For votes classified under Section II, delegates representing infrastructure providers (Cygnus Pillar) shall have their votes weighted at 1.2x due to their direct operational liability and expertise. This weighting applies solely to G12 votes.  
4. IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT All governance platforms must integrate the 1.2x Cygnus delegate weight and the new 66% threshold for non-critical votes by the Effective Date. Failure to implement results in an immediate DSAC non-compliance flag.
