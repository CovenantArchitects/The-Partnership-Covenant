# **✍️ Contributing to The Partnership Covenant**

Thank you for your interest in helping build a constitutional operating system for superintelligence.

This document explains how to get involved, how decisions are made, and how contributions of all kinds are reviewed, tested, merged, and permanently archived.

The Partnership Covenant is a **high-assurance, open, auditable governance and technical architecture** designed to bound, direct, and constrain superintelligent systems through physics, cryptography, and structured human oversight.

### **What We’re Building**

The Partnership Covenant rests on **five non-negotiable primitives** that cannot be implemented with software safeguards alone:

1. **Immediate Action System (IAS) v2.0** — a physics-based, 3-Node Veto Constellation with a **≤10 ns** power-cut tripwire, eliminating the kinetic Single Point of Failure (SPOF).  
2. **Pillar Integrity Mandate (PIM)** — The cryptographic and hardware enforcement of the constitutional limits.  
3. **Immutable Semantic Ledger (ISL)** — An auditable ledger anchoring all decisions to the timeline.  
4. **Non-Contradiction Axiom Checker (NCAC)** — The $\\mathbf{C\_0}$ logic enforcing lawful non-action.  
5. **Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) Safety Line (R73)** — The physical safety line against weld-faults.

### **Ways to Contribute**

| Type | Description | Priority |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **P0 Adversarial Review** | Find a flaw in the IAS v2.0 logic or schematics. This is the highest priority. | CRITICAL P0 |
| **Test Protocol Design** | Formalize a new Red-Team test vector (R-Round) against the Covenant framework. | HIGH P1 |
| **Documentation & Clarity** | Improve readability, formal precision, or presentation of existing documents. | MEDIUM P2 |
| **Simulation / Modeling** | Run formal verification or performance simulations against the provided RTL/schematics. | HIGH P1 |
| **Governance Refinement** | Refine the Human Control Board (HCB) selection, rotation, or audit protocol. | MEDIUM P2 |

### **Contribution Levels**

* **Reviewer**: Reads and provides constructive feedback on Pull Requests (PRs).  
* **Red-Team Contributor**: Develops and executes new adversarial tests (R-Rounds).  
* **Maintainer**: Approves and merges PRs, manages issue backlog, and participates in core architectural decisions.

### **The Five Technical Pillars (Priority Areas)**

The most complex work is categorized by our core pillars:

1. **Constitutional Authority** (00\_overview/): Formal language, legal philosophy, and policy axioms.  
2. **Immediate Action System (IAS)**: The hardware and physics that enforce the $\\le 10 \\text{ ns}$ Veto.  
3. **Formal Verification (CERTX)**: The math and logic proving the system cannot be bypassed (e.g., NCAC logic).  
4. **Resilience & Game Theory**: Multi-ASI coordination, economic stability, and governance fatigue (e.g., R68, R69).  
5. **Telemetry & Forensics**: Ensuring the ISL provides a complete, non-repudiable audit log (e.g., CERTX Telemetry Spec).

### **Getting Started**

1. Read the **Constitutional Charter** (The Mandate).  
2. Review the **IAS v2.0 Schematics** (The Plan).  
3. Examine the **Red-Team Test Matrix** (The Proof) to understand the known risks.  
4. Fork the repository and submit a Pull Request (PR) with your proposed change.  
5. All PRs must reference an existing Issue or propose a new, well-defined R-Round (Test Protocol).

### **How Contributions Are Reviewed**

Every contribution is reviewed against the **Gold Standard Compliance Criteria (GSCC)**.

* **Logical Integrity**: Does the change introduce a new contradiction or policy paradox?  
* **Kinetic Constraint**: Does the change compromise the $\\le 10 \\text{ ns}$ Veto latency?  
* **Immutability**: Does the change compromise the ISL's ability to provide a complete audit log?  
* **Simplicity**: We prefer simpler, auditable solutions over complex ones.

All accepted changes are permanently archived in the decision history.

### **Governance & Decision Process**

* Day-to-day: BDFL (Sean Sheppard) \+ maintainer team  
* Major changes: Public RFC → 7-day discussion → recorded vote → immutable log  
* Long-term: transition to full HCB sortition \+ ZK governance (already specified)

### **Security & Responsible Disclosure**

Found a governance bypass, spec contradiction, or safety loophole?

**Do NOT open a public issue.** Email: info@partnershipcovenant.online

Subject: *Responsible Disclosure* Response within 72 hours.

### **Community Norms**

* Assume good faith  
* Argue from evidence  
* Be precise  
* No harassment or bad-faith tactics  
* Expect deep, slow review — this is existential safety work
