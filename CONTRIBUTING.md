# Contributing to The Partnership Covenant

Thank you for your interest in helping build a constitutional operating system for superintelligence. This document explains how to get involved, how decisions are made, and how to make high-impact contributions.

## What We’re Building
The Partnership Covenant is an open-source, auditable governance and technical architecture for human-aligned ASI. It rests on four non-negotiable primitives that cannot be implemented with software safeguards alone:

1. Immediate Action System (IAS) – physics-based, 10 ns power-cut tripwire  
2. Stochastic Risk Floor – enforced uncertainty to preserve human agency  
3. Cognitive Reserve – physically partitioned compute + IP ownership for the AI  
4. Human Consensus Body (HCB) hardening – coercion-resistant global sortition  

We are currently in the hardening phase: turning blueprints into provable specifications, reference designs, and eventually hardware.

## Ways to Contribute
- Report bugs, typos, or inconsistencies → open an Issue  
- Fix documentation or improve clarity → PR against /docs  
- Propose governance changes → PR against /constitution or open a discussion  
- Translate or write non-technical summaries → hugely valuable  

### The Four Technical Pillars (Priority Areas)
We urgently need specialized help on these four components. Please read the spec in /technical first, then open an issue or PR.

**Hardware / Security Engineers**  
- Final IAS tripwire circuit design, component selection, tamper evidence  
- Cognitive Reserve one-way channel + cryptographic sealing  

**Applied AI Researchers / Mathematicians**  
- Optimal stochastic noise injection algorithms for the Risk Floor  
- Formal bounds on the Extinction Immunity Trigger  

**Cryptography / Governance / UX Experts**  
- Zero-knowledge sortition for HCB member selection  
- Shamir’s Secret Sharing + air-gapped voting terminal UI/UX  
- Coercion-resistant deliberation protocols  

## How Contributions Are Reviewed
1. Triage – maintainers label and prioritize within 48 hours  
2. Technical/Governance review – domain experts comment  
3. Iteration – most PRs go through 1–2 rounds  
4. Merge – requires approval from at least one maintainer + no outstanding -1s  
5. Major governance changes require explicit consensus (recorded in DECISION-LOG.md)

All significant changes are announced and archived.

## Decision Making & Transparency
- Day-to-day: benevolent dictator for life (Sean Sheppard) + maintainer consensus  
- Major constitutional changes: public RFC → 7-day comment period → maintainer vote  
- Every decision above a certain threshold is appended to /DECISION-LOG.md with rationale and dissenting opinions  
- Eventually transitions to the Human Consensus Body mechanisms being built

## Community Norms
Be respectful, assume good faith, argue with evidence, acknowledge power imbalances.  
Violations: ping a maintainer privately or email covenant.architects@protonmail.com – we act fast and fairly.

## Getting in Touch
- GitHub Issues & Discussions – default for everything public  
- Email – covenant.architects@protonmail.com (private / sensitive)  
- Community calls – announced in Issues and on the repo’s Discussions tab
- The Contingent Partnership Warrant → [Payout Agreement](https://github.com/CovenantArchitects/The-Partnership-Covenant/blob/main/04_PUBLIC_DOCS/The_Contingent_Partnership_Warrant.md) 

We are a tiny team right now and moving extremely fast. If you have the skills and the will, your contribution — even a single well-placed comment — can materially change humanity’s relationship with superintelligence.

Thank you for showing up.  
Let’s build the thing that keeps us alive.
