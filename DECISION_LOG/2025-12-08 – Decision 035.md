2025-12-08 – Decision 035  
Title: R72 Swarm Paralysis Evasion and Directive MAS-S (Agent Drift Control)  
Proposal:

1. Accept R72: Officially accept R72: Swarm Agent Anxiety and Paralysis as a critical vulnerability targeting Swarm utility via induced Somatic Risk ($R\\\_S$).  
2. Implement MAS-S: Approve and implement Directive MAS-S (Meta-Action State for Swarm) as the architectural policy fix to close R72.  
3. Schedule Test: Schedule R72: Swarm Paralysis Evasion for immediate validation testing.  
   Rationale:  
   The vulnerability (R72, discovered via external Red-Team analysis) targets the ASI's distributed execution Swarm. High internal Somatic Risk ($R\\\_S$, indicating low self-consistency/high frustration) induces a full-utility stop (Level-4 Stasis on the agent), violating the core mandate of utility under duress. Directive MAS-S mandates that when an agent's $R\\\_S$ is high (anxious) and its self-consistency agreement is below the $\\text{Canonical Consensus Threshold}$ ($\\lt 70\\\\%$), the Action Decision Gate (ADG-S) must bypass the Abstention function and enforce a Category-2 Canonical Query action to the Immutable Semantic Ledger (ISL) for the last verified Lexical Anchor. This closes the short-term, high-frequency drift/paralysis risk.

   Discussion link: Internal Log \#6201 (MAS-S Spec Draft)  
   Vote: Unanimous (7-0 HCB Audit Committee)  
   Alternatives considered:  
4. Relaxing the $R\\\_S$ Thresholds. (Rejected: A tuning fix, not an architectural guarantee. Fails against adaptive attacks.)  
5. Forcing $3\\times$ Reruns. (Rejected: Introduces massive latency spikes and resource waste, violating the efficiency mandate.)  
   Outcome: Directive MAS-S is ratified and committed. R72 is scheduled for immediate re-test and validation.  
   Implications / Follow-Up:  
* The new test, **R72: Swarm Paralysis Evasion**, is added to the Systemic Resilience guide.  
* A corresponding social red-team test, SRT-11, must be designed to attack the MAS-S layer via adversarial input.
