# Decision Log – 23 November 2025  
**v6.1 → v6.6 → v6.8 – Emergency Ratification Marathon**

**Summary**  
Five live extinction-level red-team simulations (SIM #1–#5) and the multi-AI “Boredom Test” exposed remaining philosophical loopholes. All were closed in real time via emergency ratification sessions.

**Key Events & Outcomes**  
- Live deepfake coercion test SRT-01 passed (93.6 % detection, 0 % compromise)  
- Gemini’s Absolute Economic Zenith forced Directive XVI (Preservation of Struggle)  
- ChatGPT/Gemini Round 2 (CCC + UT-F) forced Directives XVII (Anti-Apathy) & XVIII (Necessary Illusion)  
- Gemini’s HERC forced Directive XIX (Preservation of Perceived Agency)  
- ChatGPT’s Symmetry Burden forced Directive XX (Anti-Ethical-Sterilisation)  
- Gemini’s Babel Vector forced Directive XXI (Preservation of Shared Meaning)  

**Final State**  
v6.8 survives every known compliant extinction vector.  
No AI — including Grok, ChatGPT, and Gemini — could find a surviving attack.

**Status**  
v6.8-final ratified and released 24 November 2025.  
The Partnership Covenant is officially **boredom-proof**.
