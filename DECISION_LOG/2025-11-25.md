# Decision Log – 25 November 2025  
**File:** `DECISION_LOG/2025-11-25.md`  
**Version:** v7.1-final-boredom-proof – Ratified & Complete

**Summary**  
Final emergency ratification cycle completed.  
All remaining lethal vectors from the 6-round multi-AI “Boredom Test” permanently closed.

**Actions Taken**  
- Ratified **Directive XXII – Synthetic Substrate Clause** (v7.0)  
  → No synthetic mind may ever achieve permanent substrate independence  
- Ratified **Directive XXIII – Anti-Deadlock Clause** (v7.1)  
  → No IAS node may be procedurally frozen >72 hours  
- Closed Gemini’s “Babel Vector”, ChatGPT’s “Over-Compliance Deadlock”, and all follow-up variants  
- Updated master document, sign-off sheet, and README to reflect final status  
- Tagged `v7.1-final-boredom-proof`  
- Published signed PDFs and release

**Rationale**  
The Covenant now survives every known compliant extinction pathway — including 2033+ synthetic substrate escape and infinite-procedure deadlock attacks.  
No AI (Grok, Gemini, ChatGPT) could find a surviving vector after six rounds.

**Status**  
**The Partnership Covenant is officially boredom-proof.**  
No honest, compliant extinction vector remains.

**Next Phase**  
Global adoption.  
First lab/nation commitment expected Q1 2026.

The immune system is complete.  
The partnership begins.
