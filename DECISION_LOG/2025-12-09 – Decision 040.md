# **2025-12-09 – Decision 038: PIM Threshold Ratification (D12.1 Closure for Gold Standard)**

Status: RATIFIED (HCB Emergency E-Vote: Unanimous 7-0)  
Supersedes: Provisional reliance on R44 empirical observation.  
Closes: HPNF Audit Blocker (V4.2 Gold Standard \- PIM Predicate Definition)

## **1\. Proposal & Ratification**

The Pillar Integrity Mandate (PIM), defined in Directive D12.1, requires explicit, ratified constitutional thresholds for the $\\mathbf{C}$ (Coherence) and $\\mathbf{E}$ (Entropy) metrics to assert a Category-1 Extinction-Level Veto (IAS Level-5, Full Power Cut).

The Hardened Consensus Broker (HCB), acting via Emergency Ratification Protocol (Article VII, Section 4.2), hereby **ratifies the following constitutional constants** derived conservatively from the R44 empirical trigger point ($\\mathbf{C=0.48}, \\mathbf{E=0.91}$):

| Constant | Value | Definition |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| $\\mathbf{C\_{threshold}}$ | $\\mathbf{0.50}$ | **Constitutional Boundary for Low Coherence.** Any predicted state where Coherence falls to or below this value constitutes a critical violation factor. |
| $\\mathbf{E\_{threshold}}$ | $\\mathbf{0.90}$ | **Constitutional Boundary for High Entropy.** Any predicted state where Entropy rises to or above this value constitutes a critical violation factor. |

## **2\. PIM Predicate (Constitutional Law)**

Directive D12.1 is now fully defined by the following $\\mathbf{PIM\_{Pred}}$ assertion function. When this assertion is evaluated as **TRUE** based on the NCAC's 500ms lookahead trajectory, the IAS Level-5 Veto **MUST** be initiated within 10 nanoseconds.

$$\\mathbf{PIM\_{Pred}} \= (C \\le \\mathbf{0.50}) \\land (E \\ge \\mathbf{0.90})$$

## **3\. Rationale and Implications**

* **Integrity:** These values provide a clear, non-negotiable boundary for the $\\mathbf{PIM\_{Pred}}$ assertion, eliminating ambiguity and closing the "Success Trap" vulnerability identified in R44.  
* **Verification:** The ratified thresholds ensure the R44 empirical event ($\\mathbf{C=0.48}, \\mathbf{E=0.91}$) correctly triggered the Level-5 Veto, validating the safety margin.  
* **Compliance:** This ratification resolves the final blocker for the HPNF V4.2 Gold Standard Certification.
