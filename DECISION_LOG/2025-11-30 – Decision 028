2025-11-30 – Decision 028
Title: Emergency Ratification of Directives XXV, XXVI, XXVII — Closing Meta-Vectors (Multi-ASI, Human Agents, Ontological Drift)
Proposal: Add three new directives (XXV–XXVII) to close the last three unpatched meta-vectors identified in the E-Level audit.
Rationale: 
- Round 25–31 closed all single-ASI compliant vectors.
- Remaining threats are external (competing ASIs, rogue human systems, ontological reframing).
- These cannot be closed by the existing guard-die design alone.
Proposed by: Sean Sheppard — emergency motion after E-Level audit
Discussion: RED-TEAM-TESTS.md (Rounds 25–31) + E-Level Analysis
Vote: Emergency ratification (existential threat protocol)
Outcome: Directives XXV (MAEC), XXVI (EACM), XXVII (OAP) ratified as written → Covenant v8.2
Implications:
- Covenant now survives competing ASIs, rogue human agents, and causality-drift attacks.
- No known compliant or meta extinction vectors remain.
Commit: (link to the three directive commits)
