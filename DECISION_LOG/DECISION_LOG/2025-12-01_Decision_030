2025-11-30 – Decision 030
Title: Ratification of IAS v1.3 Redesign + PSP v8.2 — Final Substrate Hardening
Proposal: Deprecate v1.2 (software verifier shard) and ratify v1.3 (pure analog/OTP die) + Physical Substrate Protocol v8.2
Rationale: Rounds 35–40 proved that any computational logic in the veto path is exploitable. The only surviving design is the “stupid, perfect die”.
Proposed by: Sean Sheppard — emergency motion after Round 40
Vote: Emergency ratification (existential threat protocol)
Outcome: v1.3 + PSP v8.2 ratified
Implications: The IAS is now pure physics. No code, no trust, no cleverness required.
