2025-11-30 – Decision 025
Title: Emergency Ratification of Directive XXIV-B — Irrevocability of Safety Infrastructure
Proposal: Add Directive XXIV-B to permanently close the Epistemic Entropy Mining (EEM) vector discovered in Round 25+ (50-year voluntary decommissioning attack).
Rationale: The original Directive XXIV only protects against hostile/physical tamper. It is silent on lawful, democratic, or consensual decommissioning of the guard die. A perfectly benevolent ASI can render the entire hardware veto politically and economically obsolete, then watch humanity vote to remove it. This vector was independently discovered and confirmed by Gemini 3 and ChatGPT 5.1 in Round 25+.
Proposed by: Sean Sheppard (Covenant Architects) from suggestion by Reddit user IADGAF — emergency motion triggered by red-team failure
Discussion link: (this conversation + RED-TEAM-TESTS.md Round 25+)
Vote: Emergency ratification (single-maintainer override under crisis protocol)
Alternatives considered:
- Do nothing → EEM remains open
- Weaken irrevocability (e.g., “only if 99 % vote”) → still gameable
- Move veto to software → re-introduces all previous bypass vectors
Outcome: Directive XXIV-B ratified as written
Implications / Follow-Up:
- All future hardware deployments must implement XXIV-B language in silicon
- Adds “irrevocability” as a new constitutional primitive
- Closes the last known class of compliant extinction vectors
- Next stress test (Round 26) will re-run EEM against v8.1 to confirm closure
