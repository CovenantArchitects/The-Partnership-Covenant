Title: Establish Mandatory Governance Document Set (7 Files, v5.1)
Proposal: Require and publish the following governance documents:

HCB_INCENTIVES_v5.md
PRIVACY_TRADEOFFS.md
LEGAL_CONSIDERATIONS.md
SOCIAL_REDTEAM_PLAYBOOK.md
UPGRADE_AND_EMERGENCY.md
Protocol_ST8_Access_Decoupling.md
tests/test_to_fix_matrix.csv
Rationale: Governance must be explicit, auditable, accountable, and testable.
Proposed by: Governance Working Group
Vote: 92% approval
Alternatives considered:

Keep governance informal (rejected: non-auditable)
Publish only summaries (rejected: insufficient detail)
Outcome: Approved; CI enforcement required.
Implications: These documents form the minimum governance layer; future amendments require explicit updates to this log and ST8 tests.
Commit: filled on merge
