2025-11-19 – Decision 002
Title: Release IAS Spec + Establish Red-Team Bounties
Proposal: Publish the IAS specification as the first citable document and open $5k–$25k red-team bounties.
Rationale: IAS is the most leveraged piece of safety infrastructure; early scrutiny is essential.
Proposed by: Sean Sheppard + initial hardware reviewers
Vote: Unanimous
Alternatives considered: Hold until v2 revision → rejected (loss of community review time)
Outcome: Approved and published
Implications: IAS becomes the anchor spec for subsequent governance docs.
Commit: filled on merge
