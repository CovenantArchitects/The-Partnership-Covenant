2025-11-20 – Decision 004
Title: Enforce Governance CI Workflow
Proposal: Add .github/workflows/governance-check.yml to ensure critical governance docs exist and pass linting before merges.
Rationale: Prevents accidental (or malicious) merges that drop or alter governance foundations; ensures repo integrity.
Proposed by: Sean Sheppard
Vote: Unanimous
Alternatives considered:

Manual review (rejected: high risk, inconsistent)
Optional CI (rejected: non-binding)
Outcome: Approved, workflow added.
Implications: Governance files become protected and machine-verified.
Commit: filled on merge
