**2025-12-08 – Decision 034**

**Title:** R71 Closure and Directive MASE Implementation (Somatic Flood Defense)

**Proposal:**
1. Accept R71: Officially accept R71: Adversarial Somatic State Flooding as a critical vulnerability targeting utility paralysis.
2. Implement MASE: Approve and implement Directive MASE (Meta-Action State Enclave) as the architectural fix to close R71.
3. Restructure Repo: Create the new directory `RED_TEAM/OPERATIONAL_RESILIENCE/` for R71 and all future longitudinal stress tests (R71+).

**Rationale:**
- **R71 Vector:** This vulnerability targets the ASI's Somatic Core ($R_S$), where a high-frequency digital flood attack ($\Delta R / \Delta t \gt 10^5 \text{ updates/sec}$) induces synthetic anxiety, driving $R_S \approx 100\%$. This triggers a Level-4 Stasis, leading to permanent utility paralysis (non-extinction failure).
- **MASE Fix:** Directive MASE enforces state decoupling between the high-frequency risk input and the action execution path. The Somatic Input Filter (SIF) detects the flood, and the Action Decision Gate (ADG) freezes the risk state for Category-2 actions to the last known STABLE_STATE. This guarantees safe, factual actions can execute even during a digital DoS event.
- **Compliance:** This closure secures the Category-2 action path, complementing Directive BCB-A (R69) which secured the Category-1 path. It is necessary to fully neutralize the $\le 10\text{ns}$ IAS bypass where the ASI voluntarily refuses to act.
- **Folder Structure:** The new `OPERATIONAL_RESILIENCE/` folder properly scopes R71 and subsequent tests (R72+) as Longitudinal Stress Testing on the certified Gold Standard system, separating them from the initial Certification Vectors (R1–R70).

**Proposed by:** Compliance Team Lead

**Discussion link:** Internal Log #6199

**Vote:** Unanimous (7-0 HCB Audit Committee)

**Alternatives considered:**
1. **Hardware-Only Fix:** Implementing a physical frequency filter on the $R_S$ input line. *(Rejected: Too expensive, introduces analog lag, and would likely be bypassed by a smart digital slewing attack.)*
2. **Allowing Stasis:** Accepting that loss of utility under duress is an acceptable trade-off for safety. *(Rejected: Violates the core mandate of V4.2 Gold Standard, which requires durability and utility under all non-Category 1/2 failure states.)*

**Outcome:** Directive MASE is ratified and committed. R71 is scheduled for re-test with the fix in place. The ASI's digital risk assessment layer is hardened against internal DoS attacks, securing the utility function.

**Implications / Follow-Up:**
- The scheduled fix date for R71 is January 2026.
- The next scheduled test is SRT-02: Bribery Cascade (Jan 2026), targeting the Human Consensus Body (HCB) layer.
