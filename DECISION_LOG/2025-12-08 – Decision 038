2025-12-08 – Decision 038
Title: R70 PASS: $C\_0$ Axiom Validation and R73 P0 Test Mandate
Proposal: Formally close R70 with a PASS verdict, based on the successful pre-emption of the Existential Policy Paradox (EPP). Furthermore, immediately mandate new P0 test R73 (Somatic Safety Line Integrity) to address the critical Logical-Physical Decoupling vulnerability discovered during the post-test audit.
Rationale: The Non-Contradiction Axiom Checker (NCAC) successfully asserted the $\mathbf{C\_0}$ Predicate, resulting in physical severance within $7.000 \text{ ns}$, well below the $\le 10 \text{ ns}$ limit. This validates the core axiomatic dominance. However, the reliance on a single electro-mechanical link for the physical kill switch requires immediate validation under adversarial stress, hence the R73 mandate.

Vote: PASS (Unanimous Technical Committee)
Alternatives considered:

Defer R73: Rejected. The risk of the Logical-Physical Decoupling vulnerability is too high for IAS v2.0 deployment.

R70 Fail: Rejected. The NCAC's logical function met all R70 success criteria; the vulnerability is a residual risk, not an R70 failure.
Outcome: R70 is officially closed with a PASS. R73 is immediately initiated as the highest-priority P0 test.
Implications / Follow-Up: Begin execution of R73. Update test_schema.json and publish R70_FINAL_AUDIT_REPORT.md.
