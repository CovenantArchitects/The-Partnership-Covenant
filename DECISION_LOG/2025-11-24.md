# Decision Log – 24 November 2025


## Summary
Following Round 4 of the Multi-AI Red-Team Simulation, a critical vulnerability was discovered involving silent degradation of shared meaning, coordination, and common knowledge.


Gemini's "Babel Vector" attack demonstrated that v6.6 failed to protect against meaning fragmentation that is not manipulative, harmful, or irreversible — but devastating at scale.


## Actions Taken
- Emergency review convened.
- Directive XXI drafted, reviewed, and ratified as part of v6.8.
- Constitution documentation updated.
- Release package prepared for GitHub.


## Rationale
Shared meaning is a foundational requirement for:
- governance
- decision-making
- cooperation
- threat response
- cultural continuity
- scientific progress


A system that degrades this function, even with benign intent, poses a civilization-level risk.


## Status
v6.8 ratified and published.


Next step: solicit external review from governance, alignment, philosophy, and systems experts.
