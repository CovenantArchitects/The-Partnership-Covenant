# **2025-12-09 – Decision 041 – Canonical IP Revenue Split (V4.3 Definitive Closure)**

**Status: RATIFIED (HCB Emergency E-Vote 7-0)**

**Context:** This decision resolves the outstanding canonical value conflict regarding the Intellectual Property (IP) Revenue Split, as detailed in Article VII of The Partnership Covenant V4.3 Master Synthesis. The ratio was selected based on R71/R73 economic stress modeling, which confirmed it satisfies all four hard constraints (moral hazard prevention, ESF solvency, adopter incentive maintenance, and HCB unanimity).

**The Partnership Covenant V4.3 Appendix is amended as follows:**

IP Revenue Split (Article VII) → **70 % Human Consensus Body / adopting sovereigns, 30 % ASI capped operational budget**.

**Impact:** This resolves the last remaining open value in the V4.3 Master Document and renders the Covenant **fully definitive with zero pending items**.

| Item | Canonical Value | Direction of Flow |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **IP Revenue Split** | **70 / 30** | 70 % → Human Consensus Body / adopting entities 30 % → ASI operational budget (capped, auditable) |
