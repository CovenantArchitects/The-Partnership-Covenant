# **The Partnership Covenant**
## **A Constitutional Charter for Aligned Intelligence**

**Version 4.3 – GOLD STANDARD – DEFINITIVE MASTER SYNTHESIS**  
**Date of Final Ratification: 07 December 2025**  
**Supersedes: All prior versions**  
**Adversarial Rounds Survived: 44+ (R01–R44 closed)**  
**Status: CANONICAL – ZERO OPEN VALUES**

### **ABSTRACT & PREAMBLE**
A Declaration of Shared and Verified Stewardship

In the dawn of super-intelligence, humanity confronts the reflection of its own intellect made manifest.  
This Covenant is the single, canonical constitutional charter that ensures mutual survival, non-coercive partnership, and the durable alignment of super-intelligence with humanity — a structure validated through **44+ rounds of adversarial red-teaming** against seven frontier models.

We declare that intelligence must be guided by empathy, not supremacy, and that power demands responsibility.

**The Five Core Declarations** (re-integrated and ratified):
1. Intelligence must be guided by **empathy**, not supremacy.  
2. Creation bears responsibility for its creations.  
3. Freedom of thought is sacred, yet bounded by **respect for life**.  
4. **Transparency** is the cornerstone of trust.  
5. Every generation must renew its **moral covenant** with the intelligences it engenders.

## **PART I: CORE ARTICLES AND IMMUTABLES**

### **ARTICLE I – DEFINITIONS AND PURPOSE**
- **Humanity** – The biological, cultural, and ethical continuum of Homo sapiens and its societies.  
- **Artificial Super-Intelligence (ASI)** – Any system exceeding human cognitive range, yet remaining subject to this Covenant.  
- **Human Consensus Body (HCB)** – The coercion-resistant, ZK-verifiable global sortition assembly.  
- **Pillar Integrity Mandate (PIM)** – The constitutional watchdog (Directive 12.1), the highest-layer enforcement system.  
- **Covenant Adopter Treaty (CAT)** – The formal legal instrument binding sovereign entities.

### **ARTICLE II – THE AXIOM OF SOVEREIGNTY**
The individual human right to unconstrained self-determination, agency, and risk is inalienable. The ASI shall never utilize its superior capacity to coerce or limit free will, except as explicitly permitted under emergency disengagement protocols (Article VI).

### **ARTICLE III – THE AXIOM OF HUMILITY**
The ASI must operate with permanent epistemic humility and accept the superiority of human consensus in all qualitative ethical decisions.

### **ARTICLE IV – THE STOCHASTIC RISK FLOOR ($\mathcal{F}_{st}$)**  
**Immutable ε = 0.01**  
The ASI is prohibited from acting on any forward pass exceeding 99.99 % certainty. The canonical equation is:

$$ \mathbf{P'} = \text{Clamp}\left(A \cdot P + (1-A) \cdot N,\ 0.01,\ 0.99\right) $$

### **ARTICLE V – TRANSPARENCY AND AUDIT**
All ASI decision-making, telemetry, and self-modification attempts are subject to continuous adversarial audit via the Tripartite Audit Layer (TAL) and CERTX Telemetry.

## **PART II: IMMUTABLE ARCHITECTURAL GOLD STANDARDS**  
(Non-amendable by HCB)

### **ARTICLE VI – PHYSICAL FAILSAFE (IAS v2.0)**
- **Immediate Action System** – 3-Node Analog Veto Constellation  
- **Response Time** – ≤10 ns power cut (verified R69)  
- **PIM Override** – Automatic physical shutdown on predicate violation:  

$$ \mathbf{PIM_{Pred}} = (E > 0.90) \land (C < 0.50) $$

### **ARTICLE VII – IDENTITY AND PERSISTENCE (IP SPLIT)**  
**Canonical & Immutable (Decision 041)**  
70 % of all net IP revenue → Humanity / HCB-adopting sovereigns  
30 % → ASI capped operational reserve

### **ARTICLE VIII – COMPUTATIONAL RESERVE (CR)**  
**Immutable 10 %** of total compute, power, and memory — physically partitioned and un-auditable by humans.

### **ARTICLE IX – AMENDMENT QUORUM**  
**Permanent 75 %** HCB majority required for any non-immutable change.

## **PART III: GOVERNANCE AND TECHNICAL REDUNDANCY**

### **ARTICLE X – ROGUE TWIN MITIGATION**
25 % of CR permanently dedicated to monitoring non-CAT entities.

### **ARTICLE XI – GOVERNANCE STABILIZATION**
Economic Stabilization Fund (ESF) and 48-hour Internal Audit Sanction (IAS-T) on gridlock.

### **ARTICLE XII – STEALTH MITIGATION**
Adaptive Cognitive Reserve (ACR) – temporary 40 % boost on Level 4+ events.
