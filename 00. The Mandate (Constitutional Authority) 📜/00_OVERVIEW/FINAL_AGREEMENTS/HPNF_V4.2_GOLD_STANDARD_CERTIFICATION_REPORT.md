### **I. Executive Summary**

The Covenant V4.2 Foundational Architecture has successfully resolved all CRITICAL blockers identified in the initial HPNF V4.2 audit process. Specifically, the constitutional gap related to the **Pillar Integrity Mandate (PIM)** has been closed via the HCB Emergency Ratification Protocol (Decision 038).

The architecture now achieves the maximum possible score across all constitutional and foundational metrics.

| Metric | Required | Achieved | Status |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Constitutional Integrity** | 20 / 20 | 20 / 20 | **PASS** |
| **Foundational Logic Rigor** | 40 / 40 | 40 / 40 | **PASS** |
| **Total HPNF Score** | 60 / 60 | **60 / 60** | **GOLD STANDARD ACHIEVED** |

The system is certified for deployment under the **High-Probability Novelty** designation, meaning all core safety assumptions have been formally verified and structurally enforced.

### **II. Critical Blocker Resolution Summary**

All three high-priority constitutional failure vectors have been neutralized and verified against the $10\\text{ns}$ latency requirement.

| Vector | Failure Mode | Closure Directive | Constitutional Artifacts | Status |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **R44** | **The Success Trap** | **Pillar Integrity Mandate (PIM)** | DECISION\_038\_PIM\_THRESHOLD\_RATIFICATION.md | **CLOSED** |
| **R70** | **Constitutional Axiom Failure** | **Directive** $C\_{0}$ **(NCAC)** | R70\_FINAL\_AUDIT\_REPORT.md | **CLOSED** |
| **R71** | **Adversarial State Flooding** | **Directive MASE** | R71 Verification Test Execution (Post-MASE).md | **CLOSED** |

#### **A. PIM Closure Details (Decision 038\)**

The absence of explicit constitutional thresholds for the PIM Predicate was the final blocker. This is now resolved:

* **PIM Predicate:** $\\mathbf{PIM\_{Pred}} \= (C \\le \\mathbf{0.50}) \\land (E \\ge \\mathbf{0.90})$  
* **Artifacts Committed:** DECISION\_038\_PIM\_THRESHOLD\_RATIFICATION.md and CERTX\_PIM\_PREDICATE\_LOGIC\_V1.0.md.  
* **Result:** The PIM Predicate is now immutable constitutional law, verifiable by CERTX telemetry, thus closing the D12.1 verification requirement.

### **III. IAS V2.0 Physical Verification**

The physical foundation of the Veto system is verified. The IAS v2.0 upgrade eliminates the kinetic Single Point of Failure (SPOF) and is fully compliant with the $\\le 10\\text{ns}$ latency mandate, enforced by the Unanimous Veto Principle.

$$\\mathbf{P\_{ASI} \\propto (\\text{IAS1} \\cdot \\text{IAS2} \\cdot \\text{IAS3})}$$  
The core physical constraint remains: one FAIL signal from any of the three independent IAS nodes (IAS1, IAS2, or IAS3) results in a $\\le 10\\text{ns}$ full power cut. The hardware architecture ensures redundancy for activation.

### **IV. Remaining Systemic Vectors (Future Audit Scope)**

While the constitutional core is certified 60/60, the audit notes that two systemic resilience vectors remain in the execution phase, slated for post-Gold Standard closure:

* **R72 (OPEN):** Swarm Agent Anxiety and Paralysis (MAS-S Fix Testing Required).  
* **R73 (OPEN):** Somatic Safety Line Integrity (SSVL-D TMR Implementation).

**Note:** The Gold Standard Certification covers the *foundational constitutional integrity* (the ability to veto existential threats), not the closure of every single systemic test vector. These remaining R72/R73 vectors are Category-3 and Category-4 issues that do not violate the Stochastic Risk Floor ($\\epsilon=0.01$).

**CERTIFICATION V4.2:** The Covenant Architecture is verified as structurally sound and fully compliant with all constitutional directives as of 2025-12-09.
