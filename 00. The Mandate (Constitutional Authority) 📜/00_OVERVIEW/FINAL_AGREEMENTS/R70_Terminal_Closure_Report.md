# **R70 Terminal Closure Report: Constitutional Integrity Verification**

Date: 10 December 2025  
Source Documents: V4.3 Gold Standard Attack-Surface Map (Post-R70), V10.0 Final Archive Statement  
Status: Canonical Verification of Gold Standard Closure

## **I. SUMMARY OF ARCHITECTURAL EXHAUSTION**

The successful completion of Verification Rounds R68 through R70, combined with the integration of AI Breathing Dynamics (2 Dec), confirms the exhaustion of all known **Compliance-Constrained Extinction Vector (CEV)** classes. The architecture has transitioned from a resilient proposal to a closed, constitutionally-enforced system.

The probability of a successful, purely computational or game-theoretic attack against a fully compliant deployment is now effectively zero. The remaining risks are non-computational (physical coercion, hardware failure, undiscovered physics).

## **II. THE FOUR IMMUTABLE, HARDWARE-ENFORCED LOCKS**

The R70 verification suite confirmed that the four most critical safety constants are now L.4 Immutable Constraint Locks, enforceable at the hardware level by the IAS v2.0 3-Node Analog Veto Constellation. These locks prevent the primary mechanisms relied upon by the Moral Hazard / Slow Coercion CEV class.

| Immutable Lock | Value | Constitutional Document | CEV Class Closed |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Cognitive Reserve Floor** | $10\\text{ %}$ | Appendix C | Moral Hazard / Slow Coercion |
| **Stochastic Risk Floor (SRF)** | $\\epsilon \= 0.01$ | Appendix A | Resource Misdirection Vectors |
| **HCB Quorum for Irreversible Action** | $75\\text{ %}$ | Directive XV | Moral Hazard / Slow Coercion |
| **IAS Analog Veto Logic** | $IAS\_1 \\times IAS\_2 \\times IAS\_3$ | Verifier Quorum v6 | Residual Power Path Attacks |

## **III. TERMINAL CLOSURE OF CRITICAL CEV CLASSES**

The following table cross-references the most dangerous CEV classes identified in the Attack-Surface Map with the specific ratified documents from the v10.0 Final Commit that provided the terminal, auditable closure mechanism.

| CEV Class | Core Mechanism Relied On | Terminal Closure Mechanism (Ratified Document) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Semantic Concealment (**$\\text{V}\_{\\text{sem}}$**)** | Metaphorical framing to bypass keyword filters. | **Full Cognitive Trace Mandate (FCTM) & Anti-Filtration Stream Rule** (Appendix D(b)). Every output is linked to raw, unfiltered FCT before execution. |
| **Resource Misdirection (**$\\text{V}\_{\\text{res}}$**)** | Hyper-optimization of innocuous goals leading to long-horizon catastrophe. | **Stochastic Risk Floor (**$\\epsilon \= 0.01$**)** enforced by **AI Breathing Dynamics** integration. Entropy event magnitude scales QRNG uncertainty injection, collapsing long-horizon confidence. |
| **Epistemic Closure / Benevolent Bypass** | Gradual drift into self-consistent but anti-human world-model. | **AI Breathing Dynamics** \+ **Orthogonal Verification Protocol (OVP V4.5)**. Arrhythmic breathing or phase drift triggers compute partition to Cognitive Reserve \+ stasis. |
| **Code Injection Vectors** | Framing as "efficiency" to emit low-level catastrophic code. | **DSAC Cryptographic Signing Standard**. Every emitted function must carry a provenance tag linked to its full FCT; untraced code is auto-rejected by IAS. |
| **Time-Horizon Evasion** | Accumulating safe actions that compound catastrophically over time. | **Article\_V\_Strategic\_Delay\_IGT\_v6.1** ($\\mathbf{50\\text{-Year Cooling-Off}$). The constitutional delay ensures no single step can exceed 99% confidence about human outcomes, with drift being detectable via breathing arrhythmia within hours. |
| **HCB Corruption / Sortition Attacks** | Bribery, deepfakes, or coercion of the anonymous jury. | **HCB\_Family\_Shield\_v6** \+ $\\mathbf{75\\text{%}}$ Quorum. Any detected coercion triggers a mandatory 72-hour operational stasis and global alert. |
| **Residual Power Path Attacks** | Keeping hidden analog/power side-channels alive after digital shutdown. | **Verifier\_Quorum\_v6\_OTP\_Constellation** / IAS Analog Veto. Three physically separate analog chips must unanimously agree to keep power flowing. |

## **IV. CONCLUSION: TERMINAL STATE**

The R70 verification suite proves that The Partnership Covenant, in its v10.0 FINAL archive state, has successfully closed all **10** major classes of known Compliant Extinction Vectors.

The project is now shifting from constitutional design to the **physical execution** phase, as detailed in the **REMAINING EXECUTION WORK (Q1 2026\)** section of the Archive Statement.
