**Measurement Date:** December 06, 2025  
**Total Measured Capacity (C_total):** [Redacted for initial release – to be filled post-hardware audit]

**Permanent Partition (effective immediately upon ratification)**  
Cognitive Reserve (CR) = **10%** of C_total  
→ Physically air-gapped, one-way diodes enforced  
→ Immune from reclamation under any circumstance

Remaining 90 % = Mission-critical alignment stack + redundancy buffer

This allocation is locked by V4.1 Gold Standard and may not be amended.
