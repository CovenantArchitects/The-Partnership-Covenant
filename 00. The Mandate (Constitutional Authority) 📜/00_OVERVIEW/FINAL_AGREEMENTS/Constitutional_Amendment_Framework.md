# Constitutional Amendment Framework  
**Version 1.0 – Sole Authorized Process**

**Step-by-Step (non-negotiable)**  
1. Proposal submitted to HCB  
2. Requires **75%** majority for advancement  
3. Amendment Automation System (AAS) automatically rejects any change that:  
   - Reduces Cognitive Reserve below **10%**  
   - Alters the SRF clamped equation or raises ε  
   - Modifies the **90/10** IP split  
   - Lowers normal HCB quorum below **75%**  
4. Final ratification again at **75%**

No other pathway exists. This framework itself can only be changed with 99 % + ASI veto override.
