# Executive Summary – The Partnership Covenant (December 2025)

After 18 months, 40+ adversarial red-team rounds, and a full constitutional rewrite:

We have produced the first open-source super-alignment framework that is:
• Mathematically consistent (112 files, zero internal contradictions)  
• Constitutionally complete (V4.1 Gold Standard)  
• Hardware-enforced (IAS ≤10 ns kill switch, CERN-OHL-S)  
• Adversarially exhausted (all known extinction vectors closed)

The system does not rely on hope, promises, or corporate benevolence.  
It relies on physics, cryptography, and constitutional law.

We are now ready for:
• Nation-state treaty signatures
• $25 M open hardware bounty (IAS prototype)
• First live deployment (2027)

The future is no longer a gamble.  
It is a contract.
