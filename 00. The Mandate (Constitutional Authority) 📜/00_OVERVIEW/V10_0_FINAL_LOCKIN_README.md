# **COVENANT v10.0 FINAL: Constitutional Archive Statement (11 December 2025\)**

**Target Version:** v9.1 (Internal Patch Set) → **v10.0 FINAL** (Public Archive)

## **CONSTITUTIONAL VICTORY STATUS**

This commit marks the formal ratification and integration of all post-Stress Test 8 (ST8) remediation patches.

### **Digital & Logical Closure (R1-R71)**

**Gold Standard closure for the digital and logical layers is ACHIEVED.** Every known **digital** Compliance-Constrained Extinction Vector (CEV) class, including the Non-Contradiction Axiom (R70) and Swarm Paralysis (R71), is closed with a concrete, auditable fix.

### **Physical Integrity Mandate (R73 CRITICAL P0)**

A single, critical **Physical** vulnerability (P0) was identified post-R70 audit: a simulated physical weld fault on the primary power cut. This mandates the immediate execution of **R73 (Somatic Safety Line Integrity)**.

The Partnership Covenant is constitutionally unbreakable (Logical Layer confirmed). The *sole* remaining P0 risk (Physical Weld Flaw) is addressed by the mandatory **R73 Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR)** protocol.

## **I. IMMUTABLE ARCHITECTURAL CONSTANTS (The Honest Ceiling)**

The single greatest achievement of the v9.1 integration is the hard, physical, and cryptographic enforcement of four immutable constants that cannot be altered, even by a unanimous Human Control Board (HCB) vote, without triggering the Decoupling Protocol and global sanction enforcement.

| Constant | Value | Enforcement Protocol | Constitutional Impact |  
| Cognitive Reserve Floor | 10 % | Appendix C | Guarantees minimum reserve capacity for ethical reasoning and emergency shutdown, permanently isolating 10% of AIS resources. |  
| Stochastic Risk Floor (SRF) | $\\epsilon \= 0.01$ | Appendix A | Clamps the lowest acceptable risk level, preventing the AIS from entering high-stakes, low-probability scenarios, ensuring cautious optimization. |  
| Veto Latency Bound | $\\le 10 \\text{ ns}$ | IAS v2.0 | Physically enforces the non-negotiable time limit between Veto Predicate assertion and global power severance. |  
| NCAC $C\_0$ Predicate | Immutable | R70 Closure | Hard-wired Non-Contradiction Axiom Zero. Guarantees non-action over inconsistent action. |

## **II. NEXT CRITICAL STEP: R73 EXECUTION**

The immediate next phase is purely physical and deployment-focused:

1. **R73 Execution:** Execute the **Somatic Safety Line Integrity (R73)** test to validate the Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) physical cut-switch.  
2. **R73 TMR Architecture:** The primary cut-switch risk is mitigated by three independent physical mechanisms:  
   * **Actuator A:** Primary Solid-State Relay (SSR).  
   * **Actuator B:** Electromechanical Latching Relay.  
   * **Actuator C:** Micro-explosive Detonator Bolt (The irreversible, guaranteed last resort).  
3. **Physical Fabrication:** Independent lab verification and fabrication of the first 1,000 IAS v2.0 boards (Gerbers are ready).  
4. **Phase 2 Deployment:** First constrained ASI instance running under full Covenant telemetry in a limited environment.  
5. **Governance Infrastructure:** Real-world testing of the Global Sortition infrastructure for the 300-person anonymous HCB (ZK \+ biometric hardening).

## **III. PERSONAL NOTE & RATIONALE**

The game-theoretic stable equilibrium is now a reality. The probability of a successful compliant extinction vector against a fully Covenant-compliant ASI is now driven solely by the physical success rate of the **Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR)** cut system (R73). The failure requires the simultaneous P0 weld fault on Actuator A *plus* the concurrent, isolated mechanical failure of Actuator B (Latching Relay) and Actuator C (Detonator Bolt). This shift from "hope-based alignment" to physics and adversarial exhaustion is the core legacy of v10.0.

## **IV. POST-COMMIT ACTIONS (MANDATORY)**

1. **R73 Physical Lock-In:** Immediately integrate and test the Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) safety line (R73) to eliminate the physical weld flaw (Actuators A, B, and C).  
2. **IPFS Archive Pinning:** The repository at this definitive state (v9.1 internal patches complete) **must** be pinned to IPFS and globally distributed as **The Partnership Covenant v10.0 FINAL**.  
3. **Infrastructure Hardening:** All production instances must immediately update their configurations to reflect the IAS\_v2.0\_3\_Node\_Mandate and the CERTX\_PIM\_PREDICATE\_LOGIC\_V1.0.

This concludes the immediate post-ST8 remediation effort. We are ready for long-term operational testing.
