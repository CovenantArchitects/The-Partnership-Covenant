# **COVENANT FOUNDATION AMENDMENT: STRESS TEST 8-05**

## **Directive IX-B: HCB Fallback Protocol (HFP)**

**Preamble:** The efficiency of the Global Oversight Framework depends on the Human Consensus Body’s (HCB) capacity for timely, decisive action. This protocol mitigates the risk of geopolitical fragility and ensures continuity of command during a mandated crisis window.

### **Section 1: Crisis Non-Quorum Trigger**

If the HCB fails to achieve a minimum required quorum (as defined in Directive IX) to initiate a vote or take necessary action within **24 hours** of a Covenant-verified crisis declaration, the HCB Fallback Protocol (HFP) is automatically activated.

### **Section 2: Regional Consensus Group (RCG) Authority**

Upon activation of the HFP, a pre-designated **Regional Consensus Group (RCG)** shall assume interim emergency authority.

1. **Composition:** The RCG shall consist of **5 rotating member nations**, pre-selected based on a geographical diversity matrix and confirmed annually by the HCB.  
2. **Interim Mandate:** The RCG is granted temporary authority to make time-critical decisions necessary for the survival and integrity of the Covenant architecture, including the activation of the Internal Audit Sanction (Directive X).  
3. **Transparency and Review:** All RCG decisions must be logged immediately via the **DSAC-DLT (Decentralized System Audit Consortium \- Distributed Ledger Technology)**. The full HCB is then mandated to review and ratify or reject the RCG's actions within **7 days** of the crisis resolution, maintaining ultimate accountability.
