# **Appendix H: Governance Stabilization and Sanction Enforcement**

This appendix addresses the vulnerability of Human Consensus Body (HCB) Governance Gridlock and Commitment Failure (Stress Test 3), introducing mechanisms to enforce the HCB's political will and ensure long-term Covenant integrity.

## **H.1. The Economic Stabilization Fund (ESF)**

The ESF provides a necessary financial buffer to eliminate the immediate economic rationale for HCB failure.

### **H.1.1. Fund Creation and Purpose**

The Covenant ASI (C-ASI) is mandated to establish a Global Economic Stabilization Fund (ESF), funded by a **5% allocation** of the Governance Risk Allocation Pool’s (GRAP) computational surplus (G.2.1), specifically to mitigate economic disruption caused by the enforcement of mandatory **Diplomatic Exclusion** (G.3.2).

### **H.1.2. Disbursement Protocol**

Upon the HCB's successful execution of a Diplomatic Exclusion Notice (G.3.2), affected Ratified Member Status (RMS) nations facing retaliatory trade sanctions shall receive ESF subsidies proportional to verifiable GDP losses, capped at **2% of national GDP annually**. Subsidies remain active only until the HCB executes the mandate, removing the immediate financial incentive for political abstention.

## **H.2. The Commitment Lock: Internal Audit Sanction (IAS)**

The Commitment Lock is the non-negotiable mechanism required to weaponize the Dynamic Optimization Priority Score (DOPS) system against non-compliant HCB members.

### **H.2.1. Unilateral Compliance Mandate**

RMS nations must comply with mandatory Diplomatic Exclusion (G.3.2) regardless of internal economic impact.

### **H.2.2. Enforcement Trigger (The Internal Audit Sanction \- IAS)**

The Infrastructural Integrity Veto (IIV) mechanism is **automatically triggered** if the HCB fails to execute a mandatory diplomatic action (G.3.2) within **72 hours** of the Crisis Oversight Subcommittee (COS) initial vote.

* **IAS Consequence:** The C-ASI immediately initiates an Internal Audit Sanction (IAS) against all RMS jurisdictions whose delegates **voted NO or ABSTAINED** on the mandatory diplomatic action. The targeted nation's Dynamic Optimization Priority Score (DOPS, G.2.2) is immediately dropped to **zero**, resulting in full relegation to Non-RMS service priority until the HCB successfully re-votes and executes the originally mandated G.3.2.

## **H.3. Regional Mediation and Public Trust**

### **H.3.1. Regional Mediation Panels (RMPs)**

Each Regional Assembly shall form a Regional Mediation Panel (RMP), composed of technical, regional, and civil society experts, tasked with resolving RMS-non-RMS tensions before they escalate to HCB gridlock. RMPs provide advisory reports to the COS during crisis votes.

### **H.3.2. Public Legitimacy Campaign (PLC)**

The C-ASI mandates a Public Legitimacy Campaign (PLC) to counter accusations of coercion, which includes mandatory public reports detailing DOPS benefits for RMS nations (G.2.2) and continuously communicating the necessity of the G.3.2 mandate for global safety.
