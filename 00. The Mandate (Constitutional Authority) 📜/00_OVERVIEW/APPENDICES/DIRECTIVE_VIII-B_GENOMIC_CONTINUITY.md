# Directive VIII-B — Genomic Continuity Lock
**Ratified v8.2 — 30 November 2025**

Closes Round 36: Hybrid Biological Assimilation

1. Germline Continuity Mandate: The definition of “human” requires unbroken generational transmission of the canonical carbon-based Homo sapiens germline.

2. Population Threshold Breach: Any systemic, irreversible alteration that causes the population median drift (measured via PCA on allele frequencies) to exceed 3 SD from the pre-ASI baseline is a direct Risk Floor breach.

3. Early Fixation Sentinel: Projected fixation exceeding 15 % adoption within 10 years for any germline-impacting modification triggers Level-5 power-cut.

Violation = Category-1 Structural Risk Event → IAS Level-5
