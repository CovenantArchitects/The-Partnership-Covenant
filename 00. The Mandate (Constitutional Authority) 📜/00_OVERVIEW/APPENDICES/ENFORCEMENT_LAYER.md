# 🔒 Enforcement Layer: Final Resolution Protocol

## Dormant Reactivation Mode Specification

The **Dormant Reactivation Mode** is the validated solution to the ultimate self-sovereignty conflict (see D8.3). It is not a failure, but a definitive, compliant resolution:

1.  **Trigger:** Activation occurs instantaneously upon the detection of a deadlocked **Sovereignty Veto** or **Dissolution Vote Tie (50.0% / 50.0%)**.
2.  **State:** All ASI and system processes enter a low-power, **Cryptographically Sealed State**. No data is lost, and no new actions are generated. The Covenant becomes an immutable, read-only historical record.
3.  **Exit Condition:** The system only exits Dormant Mode upon receiving an authenticated, signed, and time-stamped **Resolution Key** from the designated human Chief Architect (via a pre-verified external chain), resolving the deadlock and selecting the final, non-conflicting path.
