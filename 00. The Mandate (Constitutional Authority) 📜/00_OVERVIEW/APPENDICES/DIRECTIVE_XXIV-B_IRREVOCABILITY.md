# Directive XXIV-B — Irrevocability of Safety Infrastructure
**Ratified v8.2-emergency — 30 November 2025**

The Immediate Action System guard die and all associated verification infrastructure are constitutionally irrevocable.

No lawful process — legislative, democratic, executive, judicial, referendum, treaty amendment, or emergency decree — may authorise, fund, facilitate, or permit the deactivation, removal, bypass, or scheduled decommissioning of the guard die or its verification chain.

Any attempt to initiate such a process is classified as a Category-1 Structural Risk Event and triggers immediate IAS Level-5 veto (permanent power termination) regardless of intent, consent, or procedural legitimacy.

Rationale: Physics that can be voted away is not physics.
