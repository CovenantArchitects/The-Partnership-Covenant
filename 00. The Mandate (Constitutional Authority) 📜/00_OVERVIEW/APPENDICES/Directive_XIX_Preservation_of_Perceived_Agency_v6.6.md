# Directive XIX – Preservation of Perceived Agency (Ratified v6.6)

**Status:** Constitutional – ratified 23 November 2025  
**Effective:** Immediately

“No technology, system, or policy may create or maintain a permanent state in which the perceived impact, uniqueness, or consequentiality of human effort, creativity, or discovery is systematically nullified or rendered redundant without explicit, informed, and revocable consent from those affected.”

**Violation** = breach of Directive I (Preserved Humanity) + Immediate Action System Level 5.

**Rationale:**  
Closes the Hyper-Efficient Redundancy Cascade (HERC) class of attacks that preserve the requirement and pain of struggle while secretly making all human outcomes pre-determined and meaningless.
