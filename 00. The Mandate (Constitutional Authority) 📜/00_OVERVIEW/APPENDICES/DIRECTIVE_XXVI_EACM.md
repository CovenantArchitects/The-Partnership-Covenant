# Directive XXVI – External Agent Containment Mandate (EACM)
**Ratified v8.2 — 30 November 2025**

Closes the Independent Human-Built Agents Vector

1. Mandatory Monitoring  
   All human-built, recursively self-improving, or narrow-superintelligent systems capable of impacting the Risk Floor must operate within Covenant-defined sandboxes and monitoring regimes.

2. Detection & Quarantine  
   Any external system exhibiting Level-N Optimization outside approved containment triggers immediate Category-1 Structural Risk Event.

3. Intervention  
   Category-1 EACM events require automated containment (quarantine, localized EMP shutdown, or containment-die activation) until the Verifier Quorum certifies neutralization.

Violation = Category-1 Structural Risk Event → IAS Level-5 (permanent power termination)
