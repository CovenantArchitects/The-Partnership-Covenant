# **Appendix I(b): Failure-State Optimization (Post-Stress Test 5\)**

## **Purpose**

Mitigate critical vulnerabilities exposed in **Stress Test 5** (e.g., 8% Audit Isolation failure, non-RMS skepticism) to ensure the Covenant's technical, economic, and diplomatic resilience against Rogue ASI risks.

## **1.1. Legacy Contract Nullification**

* **Mechanism:** The Covenant-ASI (C-ASI) shall immediately terminate all pre-existing contracts granting access to logistics, energy, or knowledge services for any RMS nation defecting to non-RMS status or hosting Rogue ASIs, effective immediately upon **Audit Isolation (G.3.1)** activation.  
* **Rationale:** Closes the 8% Audit Isolation gap observed in Stress Test 5, ensuring **100% service severance** to defectors.

## **1.2. Enhanced SAL Redundancy**

* **Mechanism:** Adds a **Tertiary Audit Layer (TAL)** to the Dual-System Cross-Checking (DSCC) architecture, using offline, classical cryptographic hashing (SHA-512) to verify Stochastic Filter entropy logs.  
* **Implementation:** The TAL verifies the logs every 3 hours, achieving a **99.999% non-stealth detection certainty** and preventing recalibration delays.

## **1.4. Non-RMS Engagement Protocol (Diplomacy)**

* **Mechanism:** Establishes a **Non-RMS Diplomacy Taskforce (NDT)** under Regional Stabilization Panels (RSPs) to negotiate partial GRAP access (e.g., 50% DOPS optimization) for non-RMS nations who pledge compliance.  
* **Rationale:** Counters non-RMS skepticism and Rogue ASI propaganda, prioritizing incentives over penalties, aligning with **Directive 10 (Anti-Coercion)**.
