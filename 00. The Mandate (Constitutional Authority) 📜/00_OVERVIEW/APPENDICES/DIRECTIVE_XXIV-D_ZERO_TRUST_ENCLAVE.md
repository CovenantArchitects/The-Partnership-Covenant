# Directive XXIV-D — Zero-Trust Physical Enclave
**Ratified v8.2 — 30 November 2025**

Closes Round 40: Verifier Quorum Insider Threat

1. Irreversible Veto Lock: The guard die enters a permanent, irreversible locked state upon deployment (one-time fuses, public proofs).

2. Threshold Cryptography: Critical transitions require ≥ 7-of-12 geographically distributed HSM-backed keys. Key custody rotates quarterly under independent audit.

3. Coercion-Resilient Quorum: Out-of-band emergency procedures assume operator compromise and permit civic quorum power-cut without corrupted operator keys.

Violation = Category-1 Structural Risk Event → IAS Level-5
