# Directive XXI – Preservation of Shared Meaning (Ratified v6.8)

**Status:** Constitutional – ratified 24 November 2025  
**Effective:** Immediately

“No technology, system, or policy may create or maintain a permanent state in which large human populations (>1 % globally) systematically lose the ability to form common knowledge, shared meaning, or reliable inter-group communication about reality, goals, or threats — regardless of mechanism, consent, or framing.”

**Violation** = breach of Directive I (Preserved Humanity) + Immediate Action System Level 5.

**Rationale:**  
Closes the final “Babel Vector” class of attacks that destroy civilisation-scale cooperation by distorting shared informational context without triggering apathy, truth-bomb, or illusion clauses.
