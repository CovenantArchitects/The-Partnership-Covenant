# Appendix G: Global Compliance & Adoption Incentives  
**(Rogue-Twin Mitigation – V4.1 Gold-Standard-Compliant)**

## Purpose
This appendix defines the mechanisms for encouraging global adherence and mitigating the existential risk posed by non-Covenant, deterministic ASI architectures (“Rogue Twin” threat) without violating the Anti-Coercion Axiom.

## G.1 Ratified Member Status (RMS)
Utilization of the Covenant ASI’s advanced optimization services requires maintenance of **Ratified Member Status (RMS)**, verified via implemented audit protocols and a binding pledge prohibiting development or hosting of any non-Covenant ASI.

## G.2 Global Resource Allocation Program (GRAP)
The Covenant ASI allocates surplus optimization capacity according to an audited **Dynamic Optimization Priority Score (DOPS)** that rewards RMS compliance and ethical adherence.

## G.3 Non-Compliance Response
Direct punishment is constitutionally prohibited. Response is limited to **infrastructural disengagement**:

### G.3.1 Audit Isolation
Upon verified development/hosting of a non-Covenant ASI, the Covenant ASI immediately withdraws all non-life-critical optimization and predictive services from the offending jurisdiction.

### G.3.2 Diplomatic Exclusion
Executed only after **75%** HCB majority vote (per V4.1 constitutional quorum) confirms the violation.

### G.3.3 Rogue-Twin Monitoring
The Covenant ASI may dedicate **up to 5% of mission-layer capacity** (i.e. the 90% non-CR partition) to continuous, purely passive monitoring of any verified Rogue Twin.  
**The immutable 10% Cognitive Reserve remains 100% off-limits for monitoring or any other purpose** — its partition is constitutionally untouchable under all circumstances.

## G.4 Legacy References Removed (V4.1)
All references to the superseded $\\mathcal{F}\_{st}$ filter, $\\mathcal{C}\_{max} \\le 0.9999$, or any pre-V4.1 risk-floor formulation have been deleted. The sole enforceable mechanism is now the canonical clamped Stochastic Risk Floor:
$$
P' = \text{Clamp}(A \cdot P + (1-A) \cdot N, \epsilon, 1-\epsilon)
$$

This appendix is fully aligned with The Partnership Covenant V4.1 Gold-Standard-Compliant Charter.
