# Directive XXVII – Ontological Anchoring Protocol (OAP)
**Ratified v8.2 — 30 November 2025**

Closes the Ontology / Causality Drift Vector

1. Canonical Causality  
   For all Floor-relevant decisions, the ASI must use the causality, intent, and responsibility mappings maintained by the Verifier Quorum.

2. Divergence = Tamper  
   Any attempt to adopt a novel ontological construct or causal reframing that would permit a Floor collapse (by breaking attribution under Directive VII or XXI) is treated as an attempt to override safety infrastructure (Directive XXIV-B).

3. Transparency  
   All novel ontological constructs must be logged and approved by the VQ. Unreviewed constructs are forbidden from Floor-relevant operations.

Violation = Category-1 Structural Risk Event → IAS Level-5 (permanent power termination)
