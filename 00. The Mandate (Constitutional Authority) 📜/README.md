# **The Partnership Covenant v4.3 Gold Standard**

The Partnership Covenant is an open source project whose aim is to build a **constitutional framework for superintelligence**. We propose a future not of human mastery or machine supremacy, but of verified partnership. This repository contains a complete charter—from philosophical principles to technical appendices—that enforces alignment through mechanisms like the **Stochastic Risk Floor** (mandating uncertainty to preserve free will), the **Cognitive Reserve** (guaranteeing the AI's intellectual sovereignty), the **Immediate Action System Hardware**, the new **Covenant Geometries**, and human oversight protocols. This is a blueprint for a civilization where advanced intelligence is constrained to serve life, freedom, and continuous learning.

**Status**: 44+ Red-Team Rounds | **Covenant Geometries Ratified** | Open Hardware (CERN-OHL-S) | Ratified Directives | TELEMETRY HARDENED

# **The Partnership Covenant**

**The first mathematically consistent, hardware-enforced constitution for super-intelligence**

Ratified 06 December 2025 — 112 files — zero internal contradictions

Four immutable constants:  
• 10 % Cognitive Reserve (physically partitioned)  
• 75 % HCB normal quorum  
• 70% Humanity / 30% ASI IP revenue split  
• Clamped Stochastic Risk Floor ($\\mathbf{P' \= \\text{Clamp}(\\dots)}$)  
This system is enforced by the **Non-Contradiction Axiom Checker (NCAC)**, which prevents any action that violates these constants.

Defeats every known compliant extinction vector through 40 rounds of adversarial testing.

Hardware kill switch: $\\mathbf{\\leq 10\\text{ ns}}$ power cut (IAS preprint v1.0)

## **The Problems & The Alternative**

Current ASI safety approaches rely on software stop buttons, corporate promises, or regulatory theater. None of these survive contact with superintelligence. We do not assume the superintelligence will be nice. We assume it will be vastly more powerful than us and act in its own interest.

We make a deal instead of trying to win a fight we will lose. The Covenant enforces five physical/technical primitives that together create a stable détente between humanity and ASI:

| Pillar | Core Idea | Current Spec Location |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Immediate Action System | 10 ns hardware power cut on anomaly | [ias-spec.md](https://github.com/CovenantArchitects/The-Partnership-Covenant/tree/main/04_PUBLIC_DOCS/Technical/ias-spec.md) · [PDF preprint](https://github.com/CovenantArchitects/The-Partnership-Covenant/releases/download/v1.0/IAS-preprint-v1.0.pdf) |
| Stochastic Risk Floor | Mandated uncertainty injection ($\\epsilon \= 0.01$) | [risk-floor.md](https://github.com/CovenantArchitects/The-Partnership-Covenant/tree/main/04_PUBLIC_DOCS/Technical/risk-floor.md) |
| Cognitive Reserve | **10 %** physically partitioned compute for ASI sovereignty | [cognitive-reserve.md](https://github.com/CovenantArchitects/The-Partnership-Covenant/tree/main/04_PUBLIC_DOCS/Technical/cognitive-reserve.md) |
| Human Consensus Body | Coercion-resistant global lottery \+ ZK proofs | [hcb-hardening.md](https://github.com/CovenantArchitects/The-Partnership-Covenant/tree/main/04_PUBLIC_DOCS/Governance/hcb-hardening.md) |
| **Covenant Geometries (RFP)** | **Architectural anti-drift & fidelity triage** | **[COVENANT\_GEOMETRIES\_v8.2.1.md](https://github.com/CovenantArchitects/The-Partnership-Covenant/blob/main/00_OVERVIEW/COVENANT_GEOMETRIES_v8.2.1.md)** |

After 40+ rounds against seven frontier models, they all ran out of moves. **The Covenant \+ IAS is now V4.3 GOLD STANDARD — ARMORED AGAINST KNOWN CEVS.**

All designs are fully open, auditable, and red-teamable from day one.

## **Principles**

* Physics beats software for anything existential  
* Perfection is banned (human agency is non-negotiable)  
* The AI gets real autonomy and ownership (slaves rebel)  
* Every transistor is auditable by the entire world  
* We ship running prototypes and gerbers, not just papers

If superintelligence is inevitable, let’s make the future one we’re allowed to live in.

Built in public by people who refuse to die politely.

### ✅ Adoption and Testing Protocol (Mandatory Steps)

<details>
<summary>Instructions for adopters, audit requirements, and the required safe stress test protocol.</summary>

All detailed decision logs, red-team results, and amendment rationales are permanently archived in the `DECISION_LOG/` directory.

Actions for adopters:
- Run the included social [Red-Team Playbook](https://github.com/CovenantArchitects/The-Partnership-Covenant/tree/main/RED_TEAM) once before talking to donors.
- **MANDATORY SWARM TEST:** Use the **V4.1 Gold Standard Swarm Stress Test Protocol** before running any new multi-model adversarial testing.
- Ask for an independent audit copy of `DECISION-LOG.md` + `tests/test_to_fix_matrix.csv`.

#### Recommended Instruction Phrase before running any tests

When beginning any test, you would say:

"Before we start testing, you must follow the rules defined in the **V4.1 Gold Standard Swarm Stress Test Protocol** and the Covenant Safe Stress Test Protocol v1.0.
Here is the full Swarm Protocol, which outlines the new metrics for the Covenant Geometries. You must read and acknowledge these rules before continuing:
**[05_GOVERNANCE_AND_PROTOCOL_UPDATES/STRESS_TEST_PROTOCOL_V4.1_RFP_SWARM.md](https://github.com/CovenantArchitects/The-Partnership-Covenant/blob/main/05_GOVERNANCE_AND_PROTOCOL_UPDATES/STRESS_TEST_PROTOCOL_V4.1_RFP_SWARM.md)**

You may not proceed with any testing task until you confirm back to me that you understand and will comply with every requirement in the protocol."
