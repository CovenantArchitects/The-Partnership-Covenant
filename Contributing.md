## **What We’re Building**

## **The Partnership Covenant is a governance and technical architecture for aligned super-intelligence, grounded in four pillars: Deep Safety & Alignment, Algorithmic Justice & Equity, Public Traceability & Verifiability, and Structural Enforcement (Veto Power). We want to create a living, auditable, and community-owned “constitution” for AI systems. Your contributions help ensure that is both rigorous and inclusive.**

## **Ways to Contribute**

### **Reporting Issues**

If you spot a problem — a broken link, typo, or inconsistency — please open an **Issue** in this repo. Provide as much context as possible (what you saw, where, how you think it can be fixed).

### **Proposing Improvements**

Major or minor, we welcome proposals. Use pull requests (PRs) to suggest:

* Edits to governance documents (charters, policies)  
* New checklists, test definitions, or schemas  
* Enhancements to existing standards (DSAC, DPS, etc.)  
  When creating a proposal:  
1. Fork the repo  
2. Create a branch named descriptively (e.g., tsc-coi-policy, add-provenance-field)  
3. Make your changes, adding tests or examples where relevant  
4. Open a PR and write a description that includes:  
* Why you’re proposing this  
* What problem it solves  
* Any backward-compatibility or breaking-change issues  
* If applicable, links to related issues or external research

### **Documentation & Writing**

Good documentation is the foundation for transparency. You can help by:

* Improving existing docs (README, charters, checklists)  
* Writing new ones (governance procedures, user guides, FAQs)  
* Translating documents or writing summaries for non-technical stakeholders

### **Technical Contributions**

If you’re a developer or researcher, you might:

* Define or improve the **Data Provenance Standard** or **model SBOM schema**  
* Build CI gating jobs, test harnesses for DSAC checks, or red-teaming pipelines  
* Write scripts or tools to generate, validate, or verify provenance metadata  
* Work on IPFS anchoring, artifact-signing, or reproducible-build tooling

### **Governance Participation**

We welcome those interested in governance to:

* Review the **TSC charter** and propose improvements  
* Serve on working groups (safety, justice, transparency)  
* Help with public engagement: community meetings, feedback solicitation, outreach

## **How Contributions Are Reviewed**

1. **Initial Triage** \- Community contributors and maintainers review new issues / PRs  
* Triage includes labeling, discussion, and alignment with Covenant pillars  
2. **Deep Review** \- Governance or technical leads (safety, justice, infra) provide domain-specific feedback  
* Proposals may require iteration or additional detail (ex: new schema fields or test definitions)  
3. **Approval** \- Once all required reviewers approve, the contribution is merged  
* For major governance changes, the **TSC** may vote before merging  
4. **Post-Merge** \- All merged changes are recorded, signed (as needed), and archived  
* Significant changes are added to the **decision log** for transparency

## **Community Norms & Code of Conduct**

We are committed to inclusivity, respect, and constructive dialogue. Please follow these principles:

* Be respectful; assume good faith  
* Engage in productive, evidence-based discussion  
* Provide feedback thoughtfully and clearly  
* Acknowledge and address power dynamics (especially in governance)  
* When in doubt: ask, clarify, and propose  
  If you see behavior that violates these norms, or feel unsafe, please raise it with the maintainers or via a private contact (e.g., email to covenant.architects@protonmail.com) and we will address it promptly.

## **Decision Making & Transparency**

* Major decisions (governance changes, veto rules, core schema updates) go through the **TSC**.  
* Every decision is documented in the **decision log**. The log includes: proposal summary, votes, dissenting opinions, and rationale.  
* We aim to keep the process open: community feedback is solicited, and working group meetings may be open or summarized publicly.  
* Documents are versioned in Git; changes are reviewed, signed, and archived on IPFS when applicable.

## **Onboarding & Orientation**

If you’re new:

1. Start by reading the **README.md** and core docs (TSC charter, DSAC, DPS).  
2. Review the **Public Engagement Drafts**.  
3. Join the **community working group** or reach out to maintainers to help with small tasks (typos, doc fixes).  
4. When you're ready, open your first issue or PR — don’t hesitate to ask for a review.

## **Getting in Touch**

* **GitHub Issues / PRs** — for code, docs, and governance proposals  
* **Email** — covenant.architects@protonmail.com for private or sensitive concerns  
* **Community Calls** — we will schedule public working-group or TSC meetings; details will be posted on the **Resource Hub**.

Thank you for your interest and for helping make The Covenant stronger, more resilient, and community-owned.
