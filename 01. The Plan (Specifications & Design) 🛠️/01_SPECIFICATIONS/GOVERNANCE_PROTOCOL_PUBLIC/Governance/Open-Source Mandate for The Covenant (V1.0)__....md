# **Open-Source Mandate for The Covenant (V1.0)**

**Pillar Lead:** Dr. Ethan Mollick (Radical Openness & Decentralization)

This mandate defines The Covenant's commitment to creating shared, transparent, and accessible AI infrastructure, ensuring that the next generation of frontier models is a collective utility, not a corporate moat.

## **The Three Core Principles of Radical Openness**

### **1\. License of Shared Utility (LSU)**

All core Covenant models, data pipelines, and foundational research will be released under a customized, open-source license. This license will permit unlimited research, commercial use, and modification, provided the modifications also maintain the same level of openness and adhere to The Covenant's Deep Safety & Algorithmic Justice principles. It is designed to maximize utility while minimizing proprietary enclosure.

### **2\. Infrastructure Decentralization**

The computational infrastructure required to run, fine-tune, and audit Covenant models must be designed for maximum decentralization. This includes architectural choices that minimize the hardware barrier to entry, facilitate federated learning across independent academic and public nodes, and prevent single-point control or shutdown by any one entity (including The Covenant itself).

### **3\. Public Traceability & Verifiability**

Every major release, patch, or modification to a Covenant model must include fully public, auditable documentation detailing the changes, the safety evaluations performed, and the training data sources used. The history of the model must be as transparent and verifiable as a public blockchain ledger. This ensures that the public can inspect and verify compliance with our Deep Safety and Algorithmic Justice principles.
