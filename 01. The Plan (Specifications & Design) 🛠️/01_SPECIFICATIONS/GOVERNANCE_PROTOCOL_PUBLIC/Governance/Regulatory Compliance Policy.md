# **Regulatory Compliance Policy (RCP)**

**Pillar Lead:** Zaria (Regulatory Compliance)

## **I. Commitment to Legal and Ethical Adherence**

The Covenant is committed to operating in full compliance with international, national, and state laws concerning data privacy, intellectual property (IP), and algorithmic transparency. This policy serves as the primary declaration of our legal obligations and enforcement mechanisms.

## **II. Data Privacy and PII Management**

Our commitment to data privacy is strictly enforced by the Data Provenance Standard (DPS) and extends to all operational phases:

### **A. Non-Retention of PII**

1. **Strict Redaction:** All Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is removed from the training corpus prior to ingestion, as mandated by the DPS.  
2. **No User Data Training:** We commit to not using user interaction data (chat history, query logs, usage patterns) generated through The Covenant's operational front-ends to train or fine-tune the core model.

### **B. Data Retention and Destruction**

1. **Ephemeral Data:** Operational data (API logs, temporary user sessions) is retained only for the minimum period necessary for security auditing and performance monitoring, after which it is purged.  
2. **Training Corpus Immutability:** Once the final training corpus is assembled, it is considered immutable. Any subsequent updates or retraining cycles require a complete re-run through the Provenance Gateway.

## **III. Intellectual Property (IP) Rights and Copyright**

We respect the intellectual property rights of all creators and sources.

### **A. Training Data IP**

1. **Licensed Content Only:** The training corpus will exclusively utilize data that is either in the public domain or licensed under open, commercially permissible terms (e.g., Creative Commons 0, MIT, Apache 2.0).  
2. **Proactive Takedown:** We maintain a formal process for handling legitimate IP and copyright claims. Upon receiving a verified Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) notice or equivalent legal instruction, the claimed data will be immediately flagged, analyzed, and permanently removed from the training corpus source files, followed by an immediate retraining of the model if required.

### **B. Generated Output IP**

1. **Open Source Output:** All content generated by The Covenant's core model will be released under an open-source license, allowing for free use, modification, and redistribution by the public. This ensures that the collective knowledge remains accessible and unencumbered.

## **IV. Regulatory Transparency and Audit**

The Covenant maintains an open-door policy for regulatory bodies and authorized auditing partners.

1. **Audit Readiness:** All provenance logs, licensing documentation, and bias assessment reports (Stage 3 of the DPS) are maintained in an auditable state, allowing external parties to verify compliance.  
2. **Change Logging:** Any changes to the Governance Structure or this Regulatory Compliance Policy must be logged publicly on GitHub, including the date, rationale, and the authorizing Governance Body (Justice, Structure, Infrastructure, or Testing Pillar).
