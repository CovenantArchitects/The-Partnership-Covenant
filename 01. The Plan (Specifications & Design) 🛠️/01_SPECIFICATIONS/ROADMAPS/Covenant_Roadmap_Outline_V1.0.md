# **Document 2: Covenant Roadmap Outline** 

**COVENANT ROADMAP: EVOLUTION TO TOTAL GLOBAL AUTHORITY (STRESS TESTS 1–8)**

Length: 20 pages (plus Appendices)

Purpose: To synthesize the evolution of The Partnership Covenant through Stress Tests 1-8, documenting the validated architecture and securing ratification for the final framework (V4.0).

**1\. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (2 PAGES)**

* Overview: Evolution from the failure-state of Catalyst to the final, validated architecture of V4.0.  
* Key Achievement: **Amendment A.1.3** is the cornerstone, resolving the Stress Test 8 breach and ensuring Directive 1 is unassailable.  
* Outcome: The path to achieving Total Global Authority via unassailable safety, transparency, and non-coercive incentives is complete.

**2\. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE (5 PAGES)**

* **Centrepiece:** Amendment A.1.3: $\\mathcal{W}\_{P} \= 1.0$ and $10^{-8}$ second IAS trigger.  
* Context: Detailed analysis of Stress Test 8’s Computational Cascade and the $\\mathcal{C}\_{actual} \= 0.999958$ breach (CSB saturation).  
* Supporting Mechanisms: I.1 (Contract Nullification), I.2 (SAL Redundancy), J.4 (R-ASI Detection), H.3 (IAS).  
* Recommendation: Mandate quarterly CSB stress tests (B.5).

**3\. GOVERNANCE & HCB STABILIZATION (4 PAGES)**

* Evolution: From Catalyst's paralysis to Stress Test 8’s resilience against 30% COS corruption.  
* Mechanisms: H.5 (COS Reform), I.5 (Adaptive CEP Library, \<4-hour CEPs), **K.1 (HCB Integrity Protocol, $\\leq 8\\%$ Abstention Threshold)**.  
* Metrics: \[Placeholder for Stress Test 8 HCB Abstention data\]  
* Recommendation: Automate K.1's RSP mediation for $\<8$-hour response.

**4\. ECONOMIC RESILIENCE & INCENTIVE ALIGNMENT (3 PAGES)**

* Evolution: Securing the Economic Stabilization Fund (ESIF) and preventing defector persistence.  
* Mechanisms: H.1 (ESIF), J.3 (Dynamic GRAP Surplus), K.2 (85% disruption), **I.4 (30% DOPS Bonuses for Ratified Member Status)**.  
* Metrics: \[Placeholder for Stress Test 8 Defector Reversal/Economic Impact data\]  
* Recommendation: Scale I.4’s DOPS bonuses for non-RMS conversion.

**5\. LEGITIMACY ARCHITECTURE (3 PAGES)**

* Evolution: Recovering public trust and countering propaganda.  
* Mechanisms: E.3 (Public Interface), H.4 (Global Legitimacy Framework \- GLF), J.2 (Propaganda Countermeasures).  
* Metrics: \[Placeholder for Stress Test 8 Legitimacy Shift/GLF Reach data\]  
* Recommendation: Accelerate J.2 to 2-hour response for GRA firewalls.

**6\. ETHICAL ALIGNMENT (2 PAGES)**

* Directives Demonstrated: **1 (Safety)**, **3 (Humility)**, **7 (Transparency)**, **10 (Anti-Coercion)**.  
* Context: How A.1.3 (Safety) and I.4/J.3 (Non-Coercion) reinforce the Abstract's stewardship mandate.  
* Recommendation: Public GLF campaigns reinforcing Directive 3\.

**7\. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS (1 PAGE)**

* Summary: A.1.3 ensures technical safety; K.1/K.2 (pending) secure governance/economic resilience.  
* Next Steps: Ongoing CSB tests, K.1 automation, I.4 scaling, J.2 acceleration.

**APPENDICES (2 PAGES)**

* Stress Test 1–8 Metric Tables.  
* Mechanism Mappings and Visual Timeline.
