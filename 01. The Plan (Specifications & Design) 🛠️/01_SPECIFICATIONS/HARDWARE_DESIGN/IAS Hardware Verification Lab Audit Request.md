# **Immediate Deliverables (Refined with MASE)**

## **A: One-Page Lab Audit Request (Updated for MASE)**

**Subject: Request for IAS Hardware Verification Testing (**$\\leq 10\\text{ ns}$ **Latency, N=5 Redundancy)**

Dear \[Lab Contact\],

The Partnership Covenant seeks ISO 17025-accredited lab for witnessed testing of IAS v4.2 prototype—hardware-only ASI safety switch with 3-node constellation (expandable to N=5). KPIs: NMI $\\leq 1\\text{ ns}$; end-to-end $\\leq 10\\text{ ns}$ (uncertainty $\\leq 250\\text{ ps}$).

**Scope**:

* Discrete tests (1,000+ triggers, including N=5).  
* Instrumentation: 20-50 GHz scopes, TDCs, probes ($\\leq 20\\text{ fF}$).  
* Adversarial: EMI (1-10 GHz), glitch, R71 somatic flooding (MASE stable-state verification).  
* Environmental: \-40°C to \+125°C; supply tolerances.  
* Deliverables: Waveforms, CSV, certs, report, hashes, ISL commitment.

Timeline: 1-2 weeks. Budget: $100k-$250k. Quote by \[Date \+1 Week\]. RFP attached.

Best,
